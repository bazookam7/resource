But when you look at it as a percentage of the sales, actually it is in proportion to what it was last quarter. As we have mentioned, on a standalone basis, the partnership factories are contributing 20% to the overall revenue as against 9% which was there last year, so that is really causing that other expenses to go high from that point of view.",

We have monitored our performance parameters continuously and that has become a rigger in the organization which you are saying slowly some input or some of the improvement in the numbers so as we gain that strength these numbers would also improve further.",

                    "Right and coming to the part of your raw material prices from the gross profit margin it looks like it is more or less stabilized, so we do not have any inventory right, high cost inventory as such less than the book?",
                    "Ok Last question from my side I just want to know if you are going to revise your guidance for FY23 that you gave in Q1 which was around sales of 3,200 Crores and margin you said it should be around Q1 FY23 which I presume it is 7.5% roughly so is there any change in your guidance or it is going to still stick to it?",
                    "Sanjay Gandhi: The H1 actually have been a very phenomenal exceptional year for us, H2 ideally speaking with the like-to-like comparison like previous year should help us in buttressing the same kind of EBITDA margin; however, we are watchful of the trend which is emerging because of recession or fear or the subdued demand. Overall as we look at a full year basis we should improve EBITDA margin compared to what it was there in last year, we should be able to get a complete hang of it I think by end of December as to where we should have a complete full year picture but definitely there will be improvement compared to last year.",
                    "The kind of the growth that we had in H1 may not be there in H2 because of the market how it is nearing, so our focus would be to maintain the market share that we have had, the growth might slowdown, the topline might slowdown but whatever we have gained we should not be losing out that market share, again that as the market normalizes then we should again grow so that is the kind of strategy that we would have.",
                    "Sanjay Gandhi: I think last year EBITDA excluding other income was close to 5% and if we include the other income we may be close to the percentage which we just mentioned but when we look at EBITDA we are looking at excluding other income so excluding other income last year it was around 5% we should see an improvement in this percentage on an overall basis for the full year.",

                    "Sanjay Gandhi: So our goal is to reach the double digit EBITDA I think in coming quarters now whether it is FY25 or mid of FY25 it is as you rightly said it is a combination of the product mix and also the macro factor getting stabilizing and then stabilizing in our favor in that sense so it should be, we are targeting towards 10% that is where we are heading.",

Starting with on the margin front so how did you manage to deliver such good margins despite an increase in revenue from partnership facilities and will margins not affect going forward assuming contribution from partnership facilities improved?",
                    "Sanjay Gandhi: You see the H1 margin improvement has been largely because of the product mix we have that is where the USP of Pearls comes into while we are expanding to the partnership factory to get maybe at a slightly lower margin at the same time our factories in Vietnam, Indonesia are in high end categories outer wear segments where the FOB price which is a realization per piece has been increasing at least in some products while it has been 75% to 80% growth compared to what it was last year. So when you look at a basket of all the product put together overseas and India, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Indonesia that give us an edge in terms of really balancing our capacity utilization across the group and at the same",
                    "Margins sustainability will depend on two things depending on the raw material prices like how jerky how frequently the spikes are how it bottoms out. So if the movement is stable so then the forecasting is possible and in that situation normally the customers that we are supplying to take the brunt of the increase of raw material prices and then similarly like when it decreases they take the advantage of it so that our operating margins or the numbers that we frame it is more or less constant and we don\u2019t have to built up inventory to supply to them so that is how our manufacturing in this industry operates."
