We continue to work on maintaining the same momentum. Having said that, the cascading effect of the global sluggishness has led to a relative slowdown of the growth in our order book for the short term. Margins of the coming quarters would be suppressed when compared to the quarter of financial year \u201923. Quarter 3, on account of this international and domestic slowdown that is still prevailing. We however anticipate that the margins for the full year to be a high single-digit on account of improved efficiency and improved capacity utilization at all our facilities.\n\nWith this, I would now hand over the call to Mr. Sanjay Gandhi, our Group CFO, who will run us through the financial performance of the company.\n\nGood morning, everybody, and welcome to our Quarter 3 and nine months financial year \u201923 earnings conference call. Coming to the financial and operational performance of the company, we have reported the highest ever nine-month performance. On a consolidated basis, nine-month FY \u201923 revenue increased by 34% year-on-year to INR 2,428 crores on account of improved product mix, better realization per piece, improved capacity utilization from Bangladesh and Vietnam factories, and improved operational efficiency in Bangladesh.\n\nAlso from Quarter 3 FY \u201923 onwards, the Alpha unit that we had acquired earlier this year has also been fully integrated. Overseas revenue continued to contribute 65% of the Group revenue. On a consolidated basis, EBITDA for nine months FY \u201923 stood at INR 193 crores, a growth of 91% year-on-year, while margins improved by 2.39% year-on-year from 5.5% in nine months FY \u201922 to 7.9% in nine months FY \u201923.",

Going ahead, in mid to long term, we are confident on the industry growth, and we believe that our company is best placed to capture the larger pie of this opportunity.\n\nThank you. We shall now open the floor for question and answers.\n\nThank you very much. We will now begin the question answer session. The first question is from the line of Nisarg Vakharia from NV Alpha Fund Management.\n\nNisarg Vakharia: Dear all, good morning, gentlemen, and good job at the margins in this quarter. Sir, you have attributed the margin expansion to synergy benefits coming from your recent acquisition. But generally, those benefits come below the gross margin level. And in this quarter, we have seen one of the highest gross margins. Just wanted to understand the sustainability of these gross margins.\n\nSanjay Gandhi: Yes, hi, good morning. This is Sanjay Gandhi. So the margin improvement, firstly, is a combination of two, three factors. One is, there is a continued improvement in Vietnam operations in Quarter 3 as we have witnessed in H1 of this financial year. Secondly, Bangladesh operations per se have shown considerable improvement when we compare year-on-year basis. Third of course is an Alpha unit which got integrated from this quarter onwards. There has been a margin improvements. So three largely are contributing to the marginal improvement.\n\nNisarg Vakharia: All these three categories are a better product mix than what we do otherwise, which would explain why the gross margins are higher?",

And we also mentioned Alpha acquisition will be revenue and EBITDA accretive from the first year itself. And this is where the operational efficiency of Alpha, and that\u2019s why we targeted that unit and in the first year itself, we are able to get return on capital employed in the range of 18% to 20% for Alpha.

Certain countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh are a mature market, where we have dedicated capacities in other facilities, which are not 100% owned by us. But we manage that. Our raw material is always ours. The whole management of the production line would be ours, but the capex would be somebody else\u2019s.\n\nSo that\u2019s the kind of model, which is much more matured in those markets. In India also, we do some of that but the market is not as matured as the other two countries. So but, these are the three places that we\u2019re taking these advantages. In terms of percentages, I would say overall percentage, I think not more than 15% to 20%, maybe like - at most, where we are using the facilities which are not 100% of ours.\n\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Pulkit Singhal from Dalmus Capital Management.\n\nPulkit Singhal: Thank you for the opportunity and congrats on an excellent set of numbers.

So normally, our comparison on ongoing basis will be year-on- year not really sequentially quarter, so whatever product mix we have achieved and which we have serviced to our customers across geographies that product mix will continue in the same quarter of the next financial year. So there is a bit of stability in terms of the product mix, which has already been achieved.\n\nHaving said that, we all know, global economic environment, how they\u2019re shaping up. All this, I think when the environment gets stabilized, there is always a scope for more improvement.\n\nPulkit Singhal: Right, right. So ones should not interpolate, basically, the 53.5% because -- so there is a sizable increase, even versus last year, the same quarter 45% going to 53%. So that is what you\u2019re calling out has been the product mix improvement, but it is not necessary the next quarter will also show a similar kind of thing. It\u2019s just a one quarter\u2026\n\nSanjay Gandhi: Yes, you\u2019re right. See, this quarter as I mentioned, there are three factors. One is product mix, second is the operational improvement in Bangladesh operation, existing factory and also the new factory which we commercialized last financial year, which is Prudent Fashion Limited. This factory was last year breakeven because it was the first year of operation.\n\nThis year, it is also generating a return on capital employed between 15% to 20%, as we mentioned in our previous calls as well.

Is it just a slowdown in the rate of growth or all do we potentially expect to commit actually, I mean degrowth likely as well?\n\nPallab Banerjee: So how we see it as of now is whatever the worst that would happen, I think we have seen that. I don\u2019t think it will go down any further. But it will -- as of now, what we\u2019re seeing is that it\u2019s not going up, the business volumes or the numbers that each of these retailers are buying, they\u2019re not bullish as of yet.\n\nSo they\u2019re, as I\u2019ve said, they\u2019re still budgeting in a manner that they would be buying 10% to 15% less or 20% less and keep that money open to react after seeing the sales. So that means that when we talk about last year, like when things were coming into a standstill, and we were going into that new kind of curve, so I think at this point of time, I would say we are at the bottom of the new curve. Like, when it starts going up is yet to be seen, that\u2019s the kind of outlook that I would present.\n\nRiddhesh Gandhi: Got it. That\u2019s helpful, sir.\n\nSanjay Gandhi: Just to add on that, specific to your point on year-on-year, basis on the top-line, there may be a marginal decline, but we are working hard to make sure that our bottom-line is reserved, and shows some improvement.",

So with that, at least we have that visibility, and we can play that.\n\nOf course, Bangladesh, Vietnam, these are the big markets at this point of time. As China is getting some kind of effect, geopolitical effect of slowdown, the business is migrating from China. And that is coming into all the other countries. The biggest beneficiaries have been Bangladesh and Vietnam, and followed by Indonesia and India, for us.\n\nSo that, I think, will continue to play. So that will continue to give us the visibility, what kind of margins, what kind of big players or as I\u2019ve said, our global competitors, how they are strategizing. So we are in, I would say, close observation, close contact, whatever you call it. And we will continue to formulate our strategy so that we can mitigate this kind of risk for our company.\n\nModerator: The next question is from the line of Raaj from Arjav Partners.

Keeping that in mind, the strategy that we\u2019ve formulated, the kind of customers that -- would be going into, so the whole mix across the globe, not only on one or two market only, it has to be much more diversified.

My question is in relation with the earlier passing month.

So, I just wanted to ask, sir, is the order momentum or say, the inquiries that we had three to four months back, have they improved or are we seeing any improvement in the order inquiry or order book as of now, as we stand today?

        "text": "Pallab Banerjee:\n\nYes, the first part of the question that you had is the scenario of getting any different. Yes, definitely four, five months back most of the retailers were struggling with the inventory. So that, I think, is tapering off now. So they are seeing some of the products which are in a higher demand, and they are planning -- giving those orders at this point of time. So that\u2019s definitely happening.\n\nTo that extent, as I said, the normal buying power that each of these retailers would have under normal circumstances, I see it still average, I would say, about 10% low. Some retailers who had bigger inventory problems, maybe at 20%, others who had controlled inventory, maybe they\u2019re already at their normal level. So that\u2019s happening.\n\nThe second part of the question is what\u2019s happening to the industry across the globe. See, there are lot of geopolitics and macroeconomic factors are playing all around. The big hubs like Pakistan is undergoing some kind of problem at this point of time. Sri Lanka, we had that problem earlier there. These are also government manufacturing hubs.\n\nIf you look at Bangladesh, also there are much better controlled, I would say, as an economy, but still the gas prices are almost more than 100% up, the petroleum and gas, and energy costs are going up. So those kind of fluctuations would be there. Pakistan and Sri Lanka had very difficult time to manage it, Bangladesh is managing it better.\n\nThe other countries, which might get affected, the smaller countries where our kind of industry is there. So that dynamic will always continue to play. And even the players, the zombies, as we call it, financially, like who have been existing because of the monetary situation of globe over the last 10 to 15 years, they would definitely be having a difficult time. Some of them will go out of the business.",

The next question is from the line of Bhavya Chheda from Seven Islands PMS.\n\nBhavya Chheda: Yes, congrats for the great numbers. So, I want just one question. What is the overall capacity utilisation for all the plants across the world, all the eight plants?\n\nSanjay Gandhi: See, we have annual capacity of 80 million-plus pieces. We are at, right now, nine months, 40 million pieces. Last year, we did 55 million pieces of goods. So we have capacity in terms of -- scaling capacity is really huge in that sense. So there is a lot of opportunity for us to scale up. I think the top-line, we can easily grow, as Pallab mentioned, at 20% for the next three years within the existing capacity also. At the same time, we keep looking for an opportunity to really see wherever we have more brownfield project, we\u2019ll definitely keep on looking to add the capacity because we see in the long term, the -- we are very positive on this growth coming back to the sector, and we\u2019ll see that once these macroeconomic headwinds are over, the tailwinds will start coming in the industry.\n\nBhavya Chheda: So we can get the percentage of capex utilization, like, right now\u2026\n\nPallab Banerjee: As we mentioned, we have our in-house factories, and we have certain capacities where our direct investment on the capex is low. So that gives us that flexibility. So today, if we look at all the factories, all the units that we have engaged in, that gives this number which Sanjay just mentioned, which should be almost about anywhere between 75 to 80 million units.",

You mentioned about the worst of inventory correction having already taken place. Now that has happened over the last two quarters. And during the inventory correction phase, obviously, the retailer demand would have been worse of, maybe 30%, 40% declined. And at that point, you have grown 26% in 2Q, and now 2%, all in 3Q.

So they\u2019re buying about 20% less, anywhere between 0% to 20%, less, I would say. The people who have got better inventory are still going ahead and buying. The other ones, that are yet to clear it off in this fall holiday season. So they\u2019re getting still cautious.\n\nOverall also, like if I look at every retailer, they are not going plus at this point of time. They would keep it minus and then keep open -- money open to chase into or take a last-minute decision or react to the market condition. So which means that the initial booking that we\u2019d get as manufacturers would be less as a whole. Of course, depending on what strategy, what positioning of we are with a particular customer, maybe we\u2019ll still be gaining market share compared to year-over-year. But generally, that\u2019s the market condition.\n\nSo in this market condition, it would be not prudent to be like very, I would say, a bit for us to say that, okay, like no, now the things are over and we will be growing. So we have to cautiously watch how this market condition evolves. We are -- you see, like certain advantages that we have, closely working with these designs -- designing those products gives us the ability also to really join hands with them for this correction at a later time. So those kind of advantages, we will have, but this is not like, I would say, already everything has happened. These are things which are all in motion at this point of time.",

So that really gets leverage. It starts happening from there as a percentage of the sales. If you see, one of the percentage of the sale of the depreciation is down from 2% to 1.6%. So our asset turn has also improved significantly.\n\nSo that also is one of the thing, which can be reflected or seen from there, which means that the existing, whatever fixed asset we have, we are able to generate either a better product, higher FOB, volume because sales volume remaining the same, what we are saying is that the realization per piece is growing high, which means a higher product is getting produced with the same manpower giving a little bit better training to them and the equipment with slight modification or addition of the equipment, we are able to generate that. So all this will get reflected in a multiple metrics. It\u2019s, there is no one metrics which will have capturing this efficiencies.\n\nPage 15 of 20\n\nPEARL GLOBAL Exceeding Expectations...Always",

So that compensates a little bit of it. There is a slight, still there is a slide dent, maybe to the extent of some decimal point, less than 1%. So that\u2019s something like we have to gain over with the efficiencies that we\u2019re trying to achieve both in terms of utilization and efficiency of manufacturing.\n\nSo overall, if you look at the markets, manufacturing markets or the ecosystem that we have in Vietnam and Bangladesh, it is definitely much stronger than what we have in India as of now for this particular industry. That\u2019s why the numbers they generate the textile -- the garment industry of Vietnam and Bangladesh are all -- both of them are $30 billion or more, compared\n\nPage 17 of 20\n\nPEARL GLOBAL Exceeding Expectations...Always\n\nExceeding Expectations...Always\n\nPearl Global Industries Limited February 08, 2023\n\nto India, which is still around $15 billion, $16 million. And India is so spread out, whereas if you go to those two countries, like it\u2019s only two or three cities which are having all this turnover.\n\nSo the ease of operation would be definitely better because of the ecosystem which is already existing. So yes, there would be always this kind of pressure would be there. Bangladesh, there is a pressure at this point of time. So the people who may not have strong, disciplined approach in their business, the 3%, 2% to 3% increase would be definitely a big jolt.\n\nSamir Rathi:",

Like that, you are actually -- the benefit that you can take off that dollar. But there are companies who are doing 100% of raw material from Bangladesh and manufacturing and shipping. So they would have the complete head, 100% of the dollar advantage to them.\n\nSo those kind of dynamics will play. So when we do a detailed strategy planning as a company, so we keep all these factors in mind, so that we can mitigate our risk. So as I said, when these conditions fluctuating and the macro factors are not in favour of us, we have to be in fully detail, we have to make those strategies very clearly so that we can manoeuvre through and continue with our promise on what we have to deliver.\n\nI hope I\u2019ve answered all the points of your\u2026\n\nWhat is like -- because things across the globe, because as far as India is concerned, we understand that we are in kind of a purple patch wherein there will be a little bit of stability, but across the globe, there are things which may or may not be in our control. And all the top Management is sitting in India.\n\nWhat exactly are the steps which we are taking? I understand that the things are spread out in India. But being the leaders and all the leaders, which are sitting in India as well, the top Management is sitting in India, should not we do enough to promote the business from India, rather than looking, say, at places like Bangladesh, where you never know what -- today say, six months back what Pakistan was, God knows what can happen to Bangladesh as well.

India could not do that. The kind of infrastructure for the industry and the ecosystem that we need for the industry, we are building it up, definitely, the current government is much more open, much more listening, but it will take a few more years.\n\nAnd we are completely clued to that. Wherever the opportunity where we can think that better return would be there from India, so these kind of investments will continue to happen in India as well. But at this point of time like or one year back, the kind of investment that we did, because we knew very well that those will give us the benefits in those countries. So that will continue to happen. We are very detailed in terms of when we are making our strategies and going into these markets. We will be going into other markets also in near future. And we will continue to get those benefits.\n\nSanjay Gandhi: And just to add, that\u2019s the advantage Pearl has. Pearl is present in four geographies. So every geography, including India, offer a potential to grow. So, currently in India, we may be doing $120 million turnover, but the potential to grow is much higher. So we are looking at a strategy of setting up expansion under PLI scheme or expansion under existing unit in India as well. So, I mean, each geography itself can go and become an independent entity.\n\nIf you look at the size of our competitor, which is there in India, probably that\u2019s an opportunity we can have for each geography so as to say, India can reach that level, Bangladesh also can that level, and so is Vietnam and Indonesia in that sense.",

So, if I were to see on the segmental performance side, I\u2019ve seen that the Bangladesh unit has been more or less consistent around 5%, 6% EBIT margins for the last 10 or 12 quarters, except for one or two quarters. So the major contributor for the current increase in margin is from Bangladesh unit, that is, it comes around 9.5%, 10% EBIT. So sir, could you just quantify as to say, the 4% increment that has happened from 6% to 10%, could you quantify that, say, 100 -- 1% is due to the product mix or 1% is due to the efficiency that has been brought by the company, or due to acquisition. If you could just give me a ballpark number as to what attributed to that increase in EBIT.\n\nSanjay Gandhi: So, I think we will not be able to give those details in terms of how much is coming from the FOB price increase, how much is coming from manufacturing efficiency and all that. So something as a metrics, we track it, we don\u2019t share it in that sense.\n\nPage 19 of 20\n\nPEARL GLOBAL\n\nExceeding Expectations...Always\n\nPearl Global Industries Limited February 08, 2023",
