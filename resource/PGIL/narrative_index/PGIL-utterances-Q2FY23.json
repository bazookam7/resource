With that let me hand over to Mr. Sanjay Gandhi, our Group CFO who will run us through the financial performance of the company.\n\nSanjay Gandhi:\n\nThank you. Good morning everybody and welcome to our Q2 & H1 FY23 earnings conference call. Coming to the financial and operational performance of the Company we have reported the highest ever H1 performance. On a consolidated basis, H1 FY23 revenue increased by 53% Y-on-Y to Rs.1711.4 Crores on account of increase in overseas revenue by 30% and India by 60%. On a standalone basis, revenue for H1 FY23 stood at Rs.628.4 Crores, a growth of 62.7% over H1 FY22. Improved overseas business performance can be attributed to improved realisations whereas in India improved performance is a combination of increase in number of pieces shipped along with improved realisations. On a consolidated basis EBITDA for H1 FY23 stood at 119.6 Crores a growth of 106% while margins improved 180 bps year-on-year from 5.2% in H1 FY22 to 7% in H1 FY23. On a standalone basis EBITDA for H1 FY23 stood at 38.1 Crores a growth of 109.6% while margins improved 140 basis points year-on-year from 4.7% in H1 FY22 to 6.1% in H1 FY23. Adjusted PBT excluding exceptional items for H1 FY23 on a consolidated basis grew 201% from 25.9 Crores in H1 FY22 to 77.8 Crores in H1 FY23. We had an exceptional loss of 22.5 Crores in H1 FY23 versus a profit of 6.5 Crores in H1 FY22. On a standalone basis adjusted PBT grew 213.5% from 10.1 Crores in H1 FY22 to 31.8 Crores in H1 FY23. PAT for H1 FY23 on a consolidated basis stood at 62.3 Crores versus 24.8 Crores in H1 FY22 whereas on a standalone basis it was 23.6 Crores versus 12 Crores.",

On a consolidated basis total income for Q2 FY23 increased by 26% year-on-year to Rs.860.3 Crores. EBITDA margin for Q2 FY23 improved from 5.9% in Q2 FY22 to 6.1% in Q2 FY23. For H1 FY23 EBITDA margin improved 180 basis points from 5.2% in H1 FY22 to 7% in H1 FY23. Margin improvement is on account of improved product mix, operating leverage and improved operational efficiency. Adjusting for the exceptional income PBT for Q2 FY23 grew by 38.4% to 32.4 Crores versus 23.4 Crores in Q2 FY22. We had an exceptional loss of 40 lakh in Q2 FY23 versus a profit of 6.5 Crores in Q2 FY22. PAT for Q2 FY23 stood at 25.9 Crores versus 25.5 Crores in Q2 FY2022. On a standalone basis revenue from Q2 FY23 grew 39% from 216.3 Crores to 300.5 Crores. EBITDA grew 75% from 9.4 Crores to 16.4 Crores. EBITDA margin improved 110 bps from 4.3% in Q2 FY22 to 5.4% in Q2 FY23. Adjusted PBT for Q2 FY23 stood at 8.1 Crores versus 4 Crores, a growth of 102% year-on-year. Q2 FY22 had an exceptional gain of 6.4 Crores. PAT for Q2 FY23 degrew from 7.6 Crores to 5.6 Crores. The reason for degrowth in that PAT for Q2 FY2022 includes the exceptional item of 6.4 Crores.\n\nPage 3 of 14\n\nPEARL GLOBAL Exceeding Expectations...Always\n\nExceeding Expectations...Always",

So far the sentiment says that this bipolar world is going to continue that means there will be a lot of policies and moves against China being the world factory so that means that the other producing regions of the world will have something to gain compared to China. So these are the couple of tailwinds that we have both in terms of raw material and in geopolitics that will continue to push us or be favorable to us so these are I would say the headwinds and the tailwinds that we have today.\n\nParth Vasani: Okay, thank you very much for the detailed answer and that was it from my side. Thank you.\n\nModerator: We have the next question from the line of Vignesh Iyer from Sequent Investments. Please go ahead.\n\nVignesh Iyer: Congratulations. Good set of numbers in a very tough circumstances and my question is on the fact that, so I am going through the consolidated P&L right so what I am seeing here is we have not deteriorated in the gross profit margin revenue in fact we have actually improved a bit so why the opex expense is so high that our EBITDA is getting impacted? Is there anything specific or is there anything one off to this quarter so I just wanted to understand that?\n\nSanjay Gandhi: Hi, There is no one-off as such we have in the opex in this particular quarter I think this quarter is having all operating expenses which are normally supposed to be in Q2 of the last financial year when we compare a like-to-like quarter-on-quarter comparison that is why you see the EBITDA margin is showing a slight improvement compared to the last year we had 5.9% in Q2 FY22 against 6.1% in Q2 FY23.\n\nVignesh Iyer: OIf like-to-like say the revenue from operation has gone up by 26% Y-o-Y but your other expenses is more than 33% if I get a rough estimate of it?",

Now spring and summer of 23 was directly proportional to the sentiments that the western markets had in the spring and summer of 22 and the fall 23 bookings or the planning that will be happening over the next couple of months would be in proportion to the sentiments that we are having now in the market. So if I look at financials of the month of October so yes there is a little bit of positive trend as you know in USA which is one of the larger markets the consumer price index have come out / increased month-on-month by about 0.4% against the expectation of 0.6%. So definitely this drop of 0.2% has been celebrated I think you have seen that overall in the market. So let us see that might give that indication that how much of interest rate the fed would be increasing eventually and when they can be able to control it but it is too early to say. What we are seeing is that October more or less most of the retailers whom we are working with have been little upbeat compared to the earlier months. It is not a situation where we are really overjoying at this point of time. Yes they have lost significantly over the last few quarters and months, so yes some of them are coming very aggressively to the sourcing side to get the price benefits as the prices have come down, so definitely I would say the margin pressure would continue to be there, but in terms of the volume I think where they bought significantly down like up to 30%, 30% plus they were buying less I think coming fall we expect that it should be a lower number, they might still buy less compared to like I would say pre-pandemic or the last year on the surge that we saw in 2021-22 so compared to that definitely there would be less buy, how much not sure as of yet, maybe 10%, 15%, maybe 5% to 10% we do not know as of yet, but yes that is the kind of",

We have the next question from the line of Riddhesh Gandhi from Discovery Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nRiddhesh Gandhi: Hi, sir just wanted to understand with this increasing base of revenue and the operational efficiencies kicking in and the utilizations kicking in yet our EBITDA margins are roughly still the same and we are not seeing an uptick is this because of the RM pressure and do we expect this to the normalize going into FY24?\n\nPallab Banerjee: The raw material price is fluctuating and in our industry like normally we pass on the raw material price difference to the customers so yes so that trend will continue. In terms of the efficiencies yes like if we are regularly with this growth and the kind of volume or the kind of capacity utilization that we are targeting towards year-on-year definitely the efficiency should be stabilizing and improving I would say.\n\nRiddhesh Gandhi: Right now how much is the kind of capacity utilization which we are running at?\n\nPallab Banerjee: The H1 that we had was definitely 90% plus.\n\nRiddhesh Gandhi: Got it understood so we are like 90% plus in terms of H1 and we expect H2 given we have probably got a reasonable amount of visibility in line with H1?\n\nPallab Banerjee: The kind of the growth that we had in H1 may not be there in H2 because of the market how it is nearing, so our focus would be to maintain the market share that we have had, the growth might slowdown, the topline might slowdown but whatever we have gained we should not be losing out that market share, again that as the market normalizes then we should again grow so that is the kind of strategy that we would have.\n\nRiddhesh Gandhi: Roughly 800 Crores of the revenue run rate is something we think we can maintain into H2 as well?",

There are customers who have very good names in the market may be like in terms of fashion and all but the financials are not okay so naturally those are the customers like we are although the opportunity exist, but we are not getting into. At the same time there are other big retailers have consistency of performance in the market and being transparent those are the ones like where the insurance and the factoring is available. So, our growth would be limited to them in terms of how we moved ahead. In terms of these customers when they buy so I think you can expect them to be better in terms of their inventory management, of course like this particular year has been bad even like the big guys like Walmarts and Targets also have created inventory issues in the supply chain. Fortunately for us we do have a little bit of pack and hold from one or two of our customers but the numbers are not that significant and we do not expect it to continue going forward.\n\nAkash Mehta: On our capacity utilization presently how much you expect the revenue from the partnership facility scale up going ahead?",

So if we look at it the first half of the quarter and the last year like we had a significant growth in our business volume so there the advantage of partnership facility will be there. As we go closer to the end of the year,it will be more of consolidation mode I do not see any increase in the partnership factory at this point of time over the next five to six months to a year, what we have already we will continue to utilize that and some of it also we will try to (audio cut) to get the maximum advantage of this business.

Our presence in the more matured manufacturing markets like Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh which all three of these have significant advantage and maturity compared to India so that gives us the second part of the confidence. The kind of strategic relationship that we have with our top five or six customers where we work very closely with them in terms of their projections and their planning for longer period of time that means more than the next few seasons so that gives us the confidence so these are the three factors that definitely helps us in terms of our order book.\n\nPrachi Sharma: Alright Sir, My next question is how sustainable are these margins and what has led to improvement?\n\nPallab Banerjee: Margins sustainability will depend on two things depending on the raw material prices like how jerky how frequently the spikes are how it bottoms out. So if the movement is stable so then the forecasting is possible and in that situation normally the customers that we are supplying to take the brunt of the increase of raw material prices and then similarly like when it decreases they take the advantage of it so that our operating margins or the numbers that we frame it is more or less constant and we don\u2019t have to built up inventory to supply to them so that is how our manufacturing in this industry operates.\n\nPrachi Sharma: Got it Sir.

So yes I cannot say that I know everything I do not have the crystal ball as yet but the trend that we have seen in this last one month has been I would say favorable so let us see that how it continues. The biggest season in retail would be this holiday season which will be this month of November and December so how it goes will play a big role in terms of the consumer sentiment.\n\nPrachi Sharma: Right Sir, Thank you so much this answers all my questions. I will just get back\n\nModerator: Thank you, As we have no further questions I would like to hand it over to the management for closing comments.\n\nSanjay Gandhi: Thank you everyone. I hope we have been able to answer all your questions satisfactorily. However should you need any further clarification or would like to know more about the company please feel free to contact our team or SGA, our Investor Relations advisor. Thank you once again for taking the time to join us on the call.\n\nModerator: Thank you. On behalf of Pearl Global Industries Limited that concludes this conference.
