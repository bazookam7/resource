Our design and product development team analyze the fashion trends and use modern technologies of 3D rendering. We do use 3D tools like CLO, Browzwear and Optitex to craft our products. Each of our locations are equipped with these digital technologies.\n\nTalking about the industry, after a subdued start of Financial Year '21 owing to the COVID-19 lockdown and restrictions, garment exports did witness a fast turnaround. This was despite the high cotton prices and the supply chain delays arising due to the container shortages.\n\nEspecially the U.S. market had a pent-up demand for apparel as the economy opened up post- COVID. Whereas now for a short run we do have a challenging macro-environment globally. These are due to abnormally high rates of inflation and huge inventory backup with large U.S. retailers.\n\nThe looming energy crisis in Europe, on the backdrop of Ukraine War, and at the same time, on the other hand, we are looking at a continuous shift of apparel manufacturing out of China. Other Asian countries will continue to gain from this shift. Vietnam, Bangladesh, Myanmar and India has been steadily gaining due to this shift. While Pakistan and Sri Lanka due to their own economic turmoil, the exporters would get a mixed bag of benefits and concerns in the short run.\n\nNow, Indian textile and garment exporters have a significant opportunity to grow with the shift of business from China. This is both due to the Xinjiang cotton which is banned, and its owned recent policies. There is high likelihood of India signing an FTA agreements with Europe and UK. The other government initiatives like the PLI, MITRA, RoSCTL schemes, the free-trade agreements provide a huge impetus heading to the growth opportunities.",

So, we are, of course like we started with them with the U.S. manufacturing, and now they are starting to source for the Europe as well from us. So, the brands which are global, definitely we would like to serve them across the globe. And then apart from that, there are other customers like Primark in UK, or the Inditex Group, which is the Zara and Bershka and all. So, we are quite big with them as well. And in Japan, there is Muji, in Australia there are Target, Kmart and Big W. So, those are also in our folio. So, those are also we are seeing substantial growth, as well as now those markets or the economies are opening up in terms of, the retailers\n\nPage 8 of 18",

We would like to have a better percentage mix across the globe. But what we experienced during the pandemic period, and just after the pandemic period, there was a huge demand, which U.S. came in first, Europe still was slow. And then the war happened, which slowed down a little bit more. And also, we saw that Japan and Australia has been really slow in terms of the demand for the last almost, if I look at one to two years period, so that definitely would change. So, to give you numbers, like at this point of time, I think in this last four or five quarters, if I look at, our presence in U.S. would be maximum, would be more than 80% or more towards 90%, I think it is 80% to 85% plus. So, that should change a little bit, as we go forward.\n\nParth Desai: And a follow-up question on that would be your most of your clients are mighty global clients like let\u2019s say Tommy Hilfiger or Calvin Klein or even Ralph Lauren. So, let's say, give you orders only for the U.S. and not, is it something to do with some trade agreements or?",

So, it's how the market changes like everything is not in our control, but when this is the strategy and this is the endeavor, and this is the way that we are progressing.\n\nHemant Shah: So, my second question would be, can this margin of 7.8% or around 8% level be maintained, because I mean, if we try to pursue this Rs. 3,000 crore of turnover, the efficiency and the utilization will be definitely good. So, is it fair to assume that margin should be in this range for the whole year, I am not talking of any quarter.\n\nPallab Banerjee: Yes, whole plan and strategy is made for that. As I said, like, there could be certain risks in the market, or in the macro factors that we are seeing otherwise, if it doesn't go overboard, like this risk doesn't become too much, or it doesn't go too much out of control. We are on that journey and that's our endeavor.\n\nHemant Shah: And if you can just give some more elaboration on this China Plus One strategy, since we are located in India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and I am sure we are witnessing some positive traction with respect to China Plus One strategy. And if you can just elaborate something what kind of traction we can see or what kind of new customers or added volumes we can see, going forward?",

The one who have got a strong supply chain or a strong sourcing base so they are able to move faster; the companies which did not have or do not have a very strong sourcing so they are following. So, that trend will continue, because see, China used to be for U.S. market almost like I think about $35 plus million. So, it's a huge market. So, it will continue to move for some time.\n\nApart from that, there are certain ones, the big ones who have very established sourcing arms. So, they are trying to now work on the non-cotton product as well.\n\nNow, the countries who have immediately benefited out of this is definitely Vietnam and Bangladesh, which numbers can tell you like you can see that they have grown at a very higher percentage compared to other countries like Myanmar, India and Sri Lanka, Pakistan so far. So, this trend will continue. And as Indian policies are becoming better and FTA discussions are on, and with the Indian demographics that we have, we do expect some more investment coming into India and India should benefit as well.\n\nModerator:\n\nThank you.

What is the capacity utilization was for, let's say, the last year and this quarter?\n\nPallab Banerjee: So, if you see, the way that we have established our factories, and the partner factories, we do have a capacity of almost about 80 million plus. So, out of that, we are at this point of time in the range of 65% utilization, I would say. So, definitely we are going towards from 65% to 75%, that's the kind of growth plan that we had for this year. And we are continuing on that journey.\n\nSo, by capacity, I mean, the infrastructure that we have created, but we are not utilizing all the machines or the workforce, like we have not put in as of yet. So, we can, without any major CAPEX investment, we can go towards this number. So, that's what I mean by the capacity.\n\nParth Desai:\n\nSo, essentially, without any significant CAPEX, you can get to 80 million type --.\n\nPallab Banerjee:",

So, this is normally the threshold hurdle which we try to say, at least a 15% plus it should start and then we reach to that level.\n\nKeshav Kumar: Secondly, the bulk of our manufacturing as per the presentation comes via Bangladesh. So, just trying to understand the EU FPA we have signed, will it be detrimental to the production via Bangladesh versus India, would it not affect us --?\n\nSanjay Gandhi: So, you see that in terms of our turnovers from the respective countries, if I look at it, close to about 70% comes from India and Bangladesh, both in between, I would say, between 30% and 40%. It should vary. So, some sometimes, like this particular quarter, if you see that India is slightly more, almost close to 38% of the turnover. So, we would continue to maintain that, of course, Bangladesh, we did recently one acquisition, so the percentage will grow up by couple of points. But more or less, it would still remain similar. India and Bangladesh doing about almost anywhere between 70% to 75% or close to 80% and Vietnam and Indonesia will do the balance.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Hemant Shah from EdhaWealth. Please go ahead.\n\nHemant Shah: I just have two questions. Now, since we have done great sales in Q1, and one of the highest sales actually in the history of the Company, Q1. And it's a dull quarter, first half is usually the lean quarter. Is it fair to assume that we can comfortably do a top-line of say around Rs. 3,100 crore or so for FY'23?",

Please go ahead.\n\nPulkit Singhal: If you could just help explain the last two quarters, Q1 of this year and 4Q I mean, you had high revenues in both the quarter. So, capacity utilization will be similar in fact higher previously. But the margin difference is quite huge. I mean, the previous quarter was 4.4, this time it's 7.9. So, what could be the reason for such volatility between two neighboring quarters?",

See this kind of model do exist in countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam, where we have partners who have been working for us with a dedicated capacity for us for some time, for more than couple of years, I would say. And in India, this concept is still quite new. So, we have started with at least one arrangement or two arrangement at this point of time, where we take that capacity and feed continuously throughout the year, and we develop it as our own factory. That's the way that we work with our partners.\n\nIn terms of return, definitely, as we have mentioned, that we do have a contract on per piece basis, where it is beyond a simple subcon, it has a little bit of profit sharing is included into it, but we do our arrangement on basis of a number of pieces that we do, Sanjay, you want to add something.\n\nPage 5 of 18\n\nPEARL GLOBAL Exceeding Expectations...Always",

So, if you could throw some news on that.\n\nAnd secondly, in that context of those issues, I mean, how is Pearl placed? Can we see this quarterly performance that you have showed in 1st Quarter, can that be suddenly impacted in another quarter by lower revenue and similarly, very low margin or do you think you have been able to do, kind of mitigate that significantly by alternate sourcingif you can touch upon that?\n\nPallab Banerjee: So, as I just mentioned, in U.S. market the big customers that we have like the Kohl's, Macy's, the PVH. So, they are projecting at this point of time a drop in numbers anywhere between 10% to 30%. So, at the same time, like our focus is to grow the other markets, so, that we do not get impacted completely due to this drop that is coming in.

We have a presence like I told you, like almost 20% of our total revenue is coming from Indonesia and Vietnam, where we do a lot of high-end products, lot of value-added products like outerwear, jackets, high-end athletic wear. So, those are of high values. And those are also supplied to the customers like who are looking for high-value product, high input in the garments.\n\nSimilarly, like in India, Bangladesh, it is generally like we are trying to upgrade our facilities to serve better and go for better price points, compared to what we have done in past. But that also depends like one is our intent and the second would be how the macro factors are playing out, like how much of those customers are buying and what kind of volumes they are driving.\n\nSo, yes, this is how it plays the outerwear, the high-end athletic wear, the high-end technical garments that we make out of Indonesia and Vietnam, definitely those have increased quite a lot. And that is shown in some of the results and also in Bangladesh or in India, like the products which cater higher FOB like more of the knits to denim, or certain outerwear jackets and all so that continues. I would say that will happen seasonally and in some seasons like we will see a mix which would be better, although like as a Company, we are focused to increase our revenue and the product mix to get better margins.\n\nAkshay Kothari: In India which branch do we sell, can you just name them?",

So, they have asked us to reduce as much as possible, hold some inventory for them, some numbers, smaller numbers, but yes, from this year to next year.

So, those kinds of goods definitely we saw an uptick in the in the demand and which is still continuing.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Shubham Jain from Revanta Funds Management. Please go ahead.\n\nShubham Jain: I had one simple question taking on from the earlier participants on the quarter-on-quarter movement of margins. You mentioned that the outerwear contribution was a little higher this quarter. So, on an H2 and H1 basis, will the margins again start moving downwards because H2 will start serving the summer-spring and the outwear will be lower so have higher revenues in the second half. But our margins can be a little subdued?",

So, we don't expect that just to survive, or just to have the capacity feel like we have to really take a huge hit on our margins.

So, there is a good amount of the product mix, which has changed in Vietnam, which has really led to higher FOB and then resulting into higher margin. That's the major one contributor.\n\nThe second is the style which were manufactured in Quarter 4 vis-\u00e0-vis what got shipped in Quarter 1, normally, we don't make a comparison from Quarter 4 to Quarter 1 because Quarter 4 is only summer-spring, but to really address that question, because some of the product as we mentioned, I think in the last quarter also in some of the discussion, that those partnerships factories, were actually starting the first phase of production. So, initially it was very important to ensure that the ramp up of the production lines is there, so, that, the workers get used to producing those many number of pieces. So, initially the pieces which were produced were on a lower margin side, rather than the higher margin, that's about India.\n\nAnd in Bangladesh also, if you really see from Quarter 4 perspective, I think the product mix have slightly changed and the efficiency has also come in the volume which has shift on the new factory has really gone up, which has resulted in operating efficiency really kicking in. And this is precisely our whole thinking was there in last time when we presented that, in going forward, I think all this factors is likely to play out and will definitely help the Company in improving the margins.",

We do in markets of Australia, we do Target, Kmart, Big W. For UK, we do Next, Primark and other brands same for even Japan we do Muji, so this it's a mix of brands, it\u2019s like we try to service these brands or these companies from multi-location and for multi-product. So, that's the strategy that we work on, its not a particular set of brands only for a certain particular set of country, that's not our strategy.\n\nAkshay Kothari: Currently 55% comes from woven and 45 from knit. So, what was this share, 5 years back, if you can give a sense of that?\n\nPallab Banerjee: So, traditionally woven has more, during the pandemic period, we saw that the knit demand was more and we enhanced our capacity for knit products as well. But I think this 55:45 is a ratio is the capacity that we have the readiness for. Now, depending on what is in demand. So, you see like for Pearl, we go to the customer as a multi-product vendor or supplier. So, depending on the need, we can flex us. A certain percentage of our factories can do both the product and can switch the lines. So, that's the kind of technological advancement that we spoke about, in our first speech\n\nPage 10 of 18",

        "text": "Pearl Global Industries Limited August 16, 2022\n\npieces on a standalone basis. EBITDA for Quarter 1 FY'23 increased by 370 bps year-on-year to 7.9%. PAT for the quarter stood at Rs. 36.4 crores versus a loss of Rs. 0.8 crore in Quarter 1 FY'22.\n\nThe increase in profitability is due to improvement in margins aided by operating leverage, better product mix and improved capacity utilization.\n\nGoing ahead, we are confident on the industry growth and we believe that our Company is best placed to capture the larger pie of this opportunity.\n\nThank you. We shall now open the floor for question-and-answers.\n\nModerator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question is from the line of Keshav Kumar from RakSan Investors. Please go ahead.\n\nKeshav Kumar: I just wanted to ask if our partnership model is similar to what our Related Party, PDS is doing with this sourcing business or is there a difference?\n\nPallab Banerjee: Our model is definitely different from PDS model. In PDS, basically, it's a more of a trading and sourcing model. Their business in terms of trading would be I would say close to about 80% plus, whereas we present ourselves to our customers as a manufacturer. We do have the partners who are working for us where certain capacities or certain factories we undertake for our production, which is completely dedicated to us. So, that capacity is completely dedicated throughout the year for us as manufacturer, whereas in trading it is as per the need. I hope the difference is clear to you.\n\nKeshav Kumar: And when we onboard a partner, do we have any return metrics in mind or are we trying to build our business for now and not like scale and not focus that much on the returns? I mean I am sure that our geography of where we get the partner would be essential. So, just trying to understand how do we if there's an internal model that we follow?",

        "text": "Pearl Global Industries Limited August 16, 2022\n\nSo, Mr. Shah, what happens in the apparel product when these big retailers are sourcing from us so they do a lot of nominated fabrics and they do a lot of negotiation along with the vendors. So, that is why a direct impact of cotton, major impact doesn't come or should not come. Whereas, if you talk of a spinner or a textile fabric manufacturer, maybe I think more in the spinner\u2019s case like it definitely would affect more, my guess I am not an expert on that. But generally for apparel manufacturer, our negotiation is to pass on the raw material prices fluctuation to the retailers and at most we have to absorb it for one season that means the order has been placed and by the time that we are looking at raw materials if there is a fluctuation, which is normally a very small percentage, or should be low percentage.\n\nModerator:\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints, that was the last question. I now hand over the floor back to the management for closing comments.\n\nSanjay Gandhi: Thank you everyone. I hope we have been able to answer all your questions satisfactorily. However should you need any further clarification or would like to know more about the company, please feel free to contact our team or SGA our Investor Relations advisor. Thank you once again for taking the time to join us on the call.\n\nModerator:\n\nThank you. On behalf of Pearl Global Industries Limited that concludes this conference.

As I mentioned like the risk is definitely like if the war happens, or another that kind of big, I would say macro changes, if it doesn't happen than we are on our path.\n\nShubham Jain: My second question is just an accounting question. In our segments that we report there is another piece which is around Rs. 130 to Rs. 140 crores of revenue, but the profit is quite volatile. So, what gets accounted for over there, because we did like Rs. 4 crores of loss in the 1st Quarter 22 and the 4th Quarter 22, but this quarter, we have reported a Rs. 12 to Rs. 13 crores profit at an EBIT level.\n\nSanjay Gandhi: Actually, the segmental part of others it include our overseas company like Vietnam and there are certain standalone also get combined here. So, actually speaking, our segmental, there is a line item for inter-company elimination. So, if you look at the structure of our transaction probably the segmental will not give the clear picture unless we do the inter-company elimination and reach a final number there. Currently, the regulation requires us to put in this way, but if you really look at it, because most of our sales from the Bangladesh and Vietnam, Indonesia is billed through Hong Kong entity and that's why the other category will have certain portion of the sale which is being routed directly. So, it does not really reflect in that way the\n\nModerator: Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, we will take our last question from the line of Nirmal Shah from Seraphic Management. Please go ahead.",

And then comes the spring summer product which is majorly coming out a lot of fashion goes out of India and some out of Bangladesh and Indonesia as well which comes because of our presence in all the four locations so we are able to balance that. And going forward we are more confident that we have the right customer mix and the right product mix we should be able to balance it better. So, that's the opportunity that that Pearl has been working on for many years and now those factories are able to churn out these expectations. So, you will see that like you know one season like when the winter season the foreign holiday imagines like which would be coming out of from the outerwear and spring summer it will be coming out from the other products like the fashion tops, dresses, the bands. So, that's the fluctuation that we can absorb.\n\nShubham Jain: To frame it in a different way, right, what I am trying to understand is essentially, we have done an 8% margin this quarter, and there's an improvement of 400 bps more or less at gross margin level quarter-on-quarter, which has helped us improve our margins. So, in the second half, when we will do a summer-spring kind of collection, can we still expect to do this 8% kind of margin or it will still be lower?",

So, that is the capacity that when we speak about capacity. And depending on the product and depending on the need of the customers, we do product. So, India basically like we are very strong in a women's products, in the lighter weight fabrics, that means the shirting fabrics, both for women's and men's and kids. And we do a lot of knit jersey products also in India.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the trend has been more towards heavier weight of fabrics, that means denim, the pant weights, the heavy drills and twills, those kinds of fabrics capacities more in Bangladesh.\n\nNow, from customer point of view, these are the bulk of the buys. So, that is why India and Bangladesh we do have about 70% of our capacity, and 70% of our turnover is coming from.\n\nNow, if I go for a particular product mix, like during the pandemic period, we saw a decline in the bottoms wear, that means the pants and denim were selling less. Now, as the pandemic is coming to an end and the markets are opening up, that demand for pants and people are going out to the offices and outside, so, pants and denims are going up.\n\nSo, that kind of variation, season to season will continue. But in majority, in a big picture like if you talk of Pearl, we are poised to deliver multiple products to the customers, and we come to the strategy so that our capacity utilization is optimum for both the countries. So, we won't say that on one season India would be slow or Bangladesh will be for more and Bangladesh will slow down and India will go up. It is not like that. So, we know what is the capacity, how to go to the customers, what kind of designs they need. But yes, general trend, the macro trend, as I spoke about the denim and pants were low during the pandemic, now that is coming back. So, those kinds of changes, you will see.",

So, that means almost 30% to 50% of the goods had not reached them at that point of time when they went on sale for the holiday season.\n\nSo, those goods were received by them in the month of January, February and even in March. Holiday season is supposed to be October, November and December. And by March, definitely it is spring, and the goods for a holiday and spring is very different. So, most of the U.S. retailers preserved those goods and they are bringing those goods in this particular holiday, they plan to bring in this particular holiday season.\n\nSo, that's one impact that we saw that the demand started slowing down. And then the cascading effect happens in the spring season as well. So, those are the two seasons which we are seeing majorly this correction would need to happen. From the summer onwards, I think they should be able to plan better and most probably they would be exhausting this the stocks which is lying there. So, if you talk of today, the U.S. market, there are very high markdowns and most of the retailers to liquidate most of these inventory, because for a retailer to have so much of inventory is also killing isn't it.\n\nSo, that's what is undergoing at this point of time. August is an important month, because this is back to school for them and it's a big season again for the U.S. retailers. So, let's see how this particular month goes and we shouldn't be able to this is the month where they should be able to liquidate most of their spring summer inventory that they have.\n\nMohit Khanna: Any categories in this let\u2019s say?",

So, as Pearl, our endeavor would be to continue to grow on those efficiencies, and thus deliver you a better EBITDA or a PAT. So, that's something, the journey that we have undertaken and you will see that continuity.\n\nModerator: Thank you. We will take our next question from the line of Mohit Khanna from Banyan Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nMohit Khanna: I just wanted to understand a little bit more what's happening on the U.S. side of the business. You said that you already have the Quarter 3 bookings, so just talking a little bit more on that. So, is it something that you are seeing in terms of rates that are coming down? Or there's a simple volume hit by the retailers?\n\nPallab Banerjee: So, yes the volumes are coming down. In terms of rate, what happens is certain portion is market driven. If like the big players like Walmart or a Target or some of the other big players drops in number then certainly market has got more capacity and less orders. So, during that time, definitely the price becomes more competitive. But thankfully, in our industry, normally the selling cost has got a proportionality to the raw material price. So, the customers normally don't\n\nPage 14 of 18",

Now, as a company, our endeavor would be to go for better margins, better product with better customers, independent of the season or the location. So, yes, like what you are talking about are the general setup of the industry and the countries. And of course, then we come in where we have to work and we have to build up our strategies so that we can deliver the best on all the four quarters.\n\nNirmal Shah: Just follow up to that, like when we will enter the second half of current year where it's probably the cotton basket would be significant from our overall spring summer collection. And if at all the various forecasts, what they are talking about some 40% to 60%, sort of a drop in cotton price. If at all that scenario plays out, then, despite let's say you retain the similar volumes, can there be an impact on the top-line? And if that happens, how will your profitability overall look like, if the cotton prices really fall through once the cotton arrival start coming from the month of October?\n\nPage 17 of 18\n\nPEARL GLOBAL Exceeding Expectations...Always\n\nExceeding Expectations...Always\n\nPallab Banerjee:",

So, the need of the product and the diversification of our production base, like for example, Bangladesh has got duty advantage for the European market already or like the FTA that we are talking about, which we are definitely talking to our customers and asking them to build up the base from now. So, those are some of the mitigation strategies that we are working upon.\n\nAnd this particular drop, what I see is for the next two quarters. So, Q2 orderbook is already there with us. Q3 is also now almost like confirmed or getting confirmed at this point of time. So, we see a slight dip, but you see we had the huge tailwind of utilizing more of a capacity increasing with the new customers and establishing ourselves with the old ones. So, that momentum is continuing. So, if we talk about year-over-year, definitely the base has grown, the number growth will be there, but yes, what we would have expected if the market had been normal then we would be less than that. We would have gone into a much bigger number if the market had continued to be like what it was.\n\nPulkit Singhal: Just to clarify, so obviously on revenue front you say there might be a slight dip, depending in Q3 or Q4, but from a margin standpoint, do you see a risk to your margin from what you have just delivered or that part you can mitigate through --?",

It has actually come down, it has not increased. though the reduction is only by three to five days, but still it is a reduction. So, as such, there is no inventory pileup, which has happened in anticipation of the order, because in our case we procure the fabric only when there is backed with a firm order from the customer. So, whatever the inventory is there, it is likely to be shipped in the coming 90 to 120 days time period. So, hedging is very clearly monitored in that sense. So, all the inventory as a percentage wise has actually improved only compared to last financial years, so, that's where we are.\n\nPage 12 of 18",

So, I think the FY'23 capacity existing one is sufficient to take care of the revenue growth what we are looking at it so there is no need for any CAPEX to build, any major CAPEX.\n\nThere will always be a maintenance or some additional expansion will keep on happening, some laundry machine to be added, some kind of a specialized machine, technology has to be added. So, those things will keep on continuing, but not the major one, like any Greenfield or Brownfield acquisitions really to add on the capacity. That's the first part.\n\nThe second part, you mentioned about the debt component. So, if we really look at our debt, composition of our debt, in terms of the long term & the short term. The long term debt is as we speak is Rs. 115 crore only, and the rest is all about the short term capital, which is a self liquidating by itself because it's largely represented by the current assets of the company. So, that is in line with the growth of the company, if you see the 95% growth in this quarter and overall, if you see FY'21 to FY'22, also we saw a significant growth and that's where the short term debt has gone high.\n\nNow, having the cash and bank balance it only helps the Company which is growing like ours, it always provide an optionality of really looking at various opportunity which can come across, whether it's value buying or it is the need for working capital for any good opportunity in terms of the business expansion, in terms of the volume growth in the current set of scheme. So, we do not have any plan of retiring any debt from the cash and bank balances which we have as of as of now, in our balance sheet, it is to bring more optionality and also it gives us financial resilience to really meet our customer requirements well on time in any situation.",
