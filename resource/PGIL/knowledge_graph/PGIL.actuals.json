four, five years, our margin used to be 2% to 1%.\n\n8740431b66afa67483f1929f7bed9bf6 --> Ms. Johnson: Last month, the board approved a budget of $2 million for the new

the operational efficiency of Alpha, and that\u2019s why we targeted that unit and in the first year itself, we are able to get return on capital employed in the range of 18% to 20% for Alpha.\"\n\n5b38507c42ed17a53f4dbd0112b3f039 --> Mr. Pallab Banerjee: So, despite the tough market condition, owing to inflationary pressure and the macroeconomic challenges, I am happy to state that we have been able to deliver a healthy top-line and a bottom-line.\n\na2720f8f9f2d6d2486b03c23f478ebac --> Ms. Johnson: Last year, we successfully reduced our operational costs by 8%, contributing to

generating a return on capital employed between 15% to 20%, as we mentioned in our previous calls as well.\n\ne794cf7094114a31b70ee4188d48c862 --> Board Member: If you see, one of the percentage of

our bottom line.\n\n6d0cc95a849858d10aeaf8655b727b78 --> Sanjay Gandhi: Happy to say that we will be reaching that return on capital employed in the first year of integration itself.\n\na812d3cf9a02e595d1335db4f5c295b9 --> Vignesh Iyer: So, if I were to see on the segmental performance side, I\u2019ve seen that the Bangladesh unit has been more or less consistent around 5%, 6% EBIT margins for the last 10 or 12 quarters, except for one or two quarters.\n\na812d3cf9a02e595d1335db4f5c295b9 --> Vignesh Iyer: So the major contributor for the current increase in margin is from Bangladesh unit, that is, it comes around 9.5%, 10% EBIT.\n\n2cc7f88c95a88080ca20d67b6932c4e5 --> Pallab Banerjee: As I said, earlier, so there is definitely, at this point of time, an inflation, about more than couple of percent. But at the same time, the dollar advantage does compensate that. So its impact is much less than 1% also.\n\nb1bdd481087b30004d5b965e893062c1 --> Board Member: \"Adjusted PBT for Q3FY23 increased by 115.8% compared to Q3FY22.\"\n\nb1bdd481087b30004d5b965e893062c1 --> Board Member: \"Margin for Q3FY23 was 6.1%.\"\n\nb1bdd481087b30004d5b965e893062c1 --> Board Member: \"EBITDA for Q3FY23 was 42.7.\"\n\nb1bdd481087b30004d5b965e893062c1 --> Board Member: \"PAT for Q3FY23 was 37.4.\"\n\nb1bdd481087b30004d5b965e893062c1 --> Board Member: \"Adjusted PBT excludes exceptional loss of Rs 21 lakhs in Q3FY22 and a loss of Rs 2 crores in Q3FY23.\"\n\n94326e64eb3b0d65c7174d3edf84969c --> Mr. Pallab Banerjee: \"Improving efficiencies at other facilities especially the ones in Bangladesh, has helped in improving the overall profitability during the quarter.\"\n\n1885e2051a99d03cf6cc3b401d81ed04 --> Document: Profit and Loss (INR CRS.)
