So a lot of focus from our side is moving on promoting these products digitally and selling them also digitally. You asked me what is the projection we have for Carvaan going forward? With so much of uncertainty that are sitting in. All I am going to go back and commit to you is Carvaan will be a breakeven product. I am not going to project Carvaan is going to be making money in the next three to six months. Carvaan will be a breakeven or a very, very marginal profit number. Are we happy with the 138000 number? No. We people are used to do 250,000, 260,000 per quarter number, we are not at all happy with 138000 number, but to increase the number is very tempting to start doing marketing campaigns to generate demand, create awareness. We do not want to do that at this stage.\n\nAnkit: Any number at which you will start generating profits on this in Carvaan?\n\nVikram Mehra: Carvaan for the first two years also made profit. Carvaan has incurred a loss only in the year three because of the Q4 fiasco. Carvaan always generated profits. Out of the three years, Carvaan has been existent of first year and the second year was the profit-making year, and I see no reason right now going forward why it will be any different.\n\nAnkit: Secondly on budget for new music acquisition, since FY2020 we have not seen anything on new music, significantly on new music acquisition and we had a budget of let us say 200 Crores to be spent over FY2022. So we are still sticking to that budget or will there be any increase or decrease in that?",

What we have shown with this year\u2019s growth is that how efficient our system is\u2026. With no content cost coming in, the system can be strongly profitable in the short run. We will try to maintain profitability and keep on investing in new content too. So you will see us spending more and more on content and the marketing costs for the content in the next 12 to 15 months.\n\nAs film production starts, we will start acquiring large amount of Bollywood films music. We are currently invested in four big Bollywood films and eight Tamil films. We are in very advanced stages to close deals for some other large Bollywood films music. Another track we have been maintaining all throughout, is that in music segment, the large growth may come not only from Bollywood, but from regional content too. That is the trend we have seen across all digital consumption in India. Even in television & digital video content, we are seeing large amount of growth happening in regional languages. We also have been investing heavy in Tamil, Bhojpuri, Gujarati, and Punjabi music over the last 12 months. Within a span of 8 months, we have become one of the leading Bhojpuri music players, with every A-list singer releasing his/her songs with us. Same is the situation in Gujarati. All the A list singers are now working with Saregama, some of them in fact on an exclusive basis.\n\nWe launched our Bhojpuri YouTube channel in February 2020 and then Covid happened. Still we managed to grow the channel. It has clocked 300Mn views in 9 months period. We are very happy with the way our regional catalogue is shaping up.",

We are doing a lot of Hindi music, you will call independent. We call it the Hindi original music. There are similarly lot of independent original music in Bhojpuri, Gujarati, Punjabi, Tamil and now Telugu. There are large investments going in, but as the company, there are boundaries they are growing. We are not getting into international music. We have gone to play to our strengths rather than to our weakness. International music consumption is very little in India. It is still primarily Indian music that does much better. We have a 1.3 billion population to play on with. This is our strength because we are sitting on the largest catalogue of this music. It makes sense to strengthen our strength because nobody else can challenge us there. Are we investing in podcast? Yes, we currently have started broadcast on Carvaan. We are currently sitting on 289 podcasts that we people are creating. That is an area we are seriously looking at. Obviously, the focus is more on music-based podcasts, but we are looking at other podcasts too.\n\nDhwanil Desai: Okay. Thanks Vikram. Very helpful and all the best.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ankit from Bamboo Capital. Please go ahead.",

We have seen when Hindi theatres open in the Hindi heartland with full occupancy because that is a time big film producers will start releasing the films. Only then we will get music in our hands. So our intent is there very clearly to grab at least 20% of the new music and we enter the next financial year without intent. Hopefully, with films getting released we will be able to fulfill that intent.

We will rely only and only on consumer demand, but the great part is that demand is picking up.\n\nDuring this quarter, we launched two of our Carvaan variants. One is Carvaan Mini Kids, targeted at young kids, in the age-group of 3 to 10 yrs. It has got Nursery Rhymes in English and Hindi, stories for children in English and Hindi and the mantras including Gayatri and Maha Mritunjay mantras etc. This product has met with great success. We are seeing a lot of traction despite zero marketing from our side. There are parents who are very wary of their children sitting at home and constantly being glued onto TV screens or mobile screens, they are finding this product handy.\n\nThe product is especially very close to our heart as it was conceptualized, developed, manufactured and launched during the lockdown. It\u2019s a testament of the speed at which we at Saregama can turn around projects.\n\nThe second product we launched during this time was Carvaan Karaoke. Like in the past, we launched this new product with minimal volumes to test the customer reactions. It has been priced at Rs.20000. The initial feedback has been very, very positive. What it is also doing, is keeping the brand Carvaan alive in the market without spending any money on the marketing side. Something I said last time also\u2026 we believe that full vaccine rollout is still a few months away\u2026 till than elderly will continue being super cautious and stay at home. This creates a great market opportunity for Carvaan.",

        "text": "Vikram Mehra:\n\nThank you. Very good afternoon to all of you people. Last nine months have seen COVID hit our country very hard, but the good news is we are slowly coming out of it. Most industries are now showing growth and I am genuinely hoping that our story should be like our cricket team\u2019s story. We were beaten very, very badly in the first test match, and the first quarter of the financial year, but just like the cricket team hopefully we will all come out as winner in the end because most companies have become leaner and more efficient to fight the COVID crisis. I genuinely believe that Economy we will come out stronger eventually.\n\nAs I have been maintaining in all my quarterly calls India\u2019s primary story is the digitization story. India has 1.3 billion people with the second largest smartphone population in the world. It also has the cheapest data that we can find anywhere. When combined with the weak out-of-home entertainment infrastructure compared to the developed countries, it creates the perfect recipe for people to consume more and more of entertainment, and edutainment, all sitting in the comfort of their homes. This consumption-from-home phenomenon has further accelerated during the COVID time.\n\nYou are now seeing more and more people consuming content on their smartphones or tablets, at the time of their choice and the content of their choice. With the biggest IP catalogue in India including Music IP across languages, Films and Television serials; all fully digitized with rich meta data sitting behind it; with a robust in-house data engine allowing us to run data analytics on the performance of every song on every platform,\n\nPage 2 of 19",

        "text": "Saregama India Limited January 22, 2021\n\nIn this quarter, brands like Google, Lux, Dabur Chyawanprash and KitKat used Saregama songs in their ads. Our sound-recording or our lyrics were used in their ads. What is it all resulting into\u2026. A steady growth in our revenues!\n\nIt\u2019s a combination of the industry growth and increase in our market share.\n\nWhile industry growth contributes 11-12%, another 10% growth comes from increase in our market share: a combination of increasing popularity of retro music and our investment in newer content. You may ask, how can we suddenly claim that retro music is becoming popular? Check out TV serials today; check out latest digital series on Netflix or Hostar or MX Player \u2026 you will find retro music being included everywhere. I will give a lot of credit to our own team and also to the changing taste of our country, but the biggest credit we always give to this product called Carvaan. Carvaan has suddenly made retro music fashionable, cool in our country.\n\nLet me give you an example of the new film Ludo. The song O Babu Ji, which was done very well in Ludo, was originally picturized in the movie Albela on Bhagwan Dada. Many of the younger people would not even know about Bhagwan Dada. They got introduced to this really old song through Ludo, and now they love it. To validate the song\u2019s popularity, you need to check the short format apps like Instagram, Josh, Triller, Noj etc. You will find hordes of younger people uploading their video using O Babuji song. So overall retro is becoming popular and Carvaan has played a big role in making retro so much cooler.",

Once we realize that we are sitting on these kinds of budgets, it will become little difficult to negotiate, but what I can tell you is that a commitment we have been making for the last two years on the music side. We will spend only the money that the music segment is generating. We are a debt free company; we will remain debts free company. Other way I can answer your question is that we are looking at acquiring at least 20% of the newer contents in terms of cost and in terms of the number of songs that will released, is the aim, we have going for over next 12 months.\n\nDhwanil Desai: Second question Vikram is on Carvaan. I think you know we started with one variant and then we went into the second variant and then multiple variants. I think I do not have a count at the top of my head, but you know must be having investments in Carvaan. My question is that you know, it is good to see that we are trying to address so many different sections of society, but even that in one sense stretching our bandwidth in terms of scaling up a very focused segment to the next level if you can share your thoughts on that.\n\nPage 8 of 19\n\nSaregama India Limited January 22, 2021",

Vikram on the Carvaan part if you can explain we are seeing pretty good traction in the sales number this quarter and as you have been highlighting the sales has been without any significant marketing expense. So how do you see that sales panning out over the next two quarters given the quarter-on-quarter that we have seen over the past three quarters and also if you can tell us how has been the online sales of the proportion since a lot of shift has happened in the buying pattern of people post COVID. So how has that channel picked up in our strategy for that channel going forward?\n\nVikram Mehra: Let me answer the last part first. Yes, the share on digital sales has gone up for us also substantially. More and more people are buying online and remember a digital sale for a company like ours must be looked in two ways. One, what is Saregama selling on digital. We sell through Amazon, we sell through Flipkart, we sell through PayTM, there are 11 different partners through, which we are selling, and we are selling from saregama.com. That number is completely on top of it, but a small retailer got a shop maybe in Amritsar. That retailer of mine, I have given it to him to sell it, right now from shop. He may also be selling digitally, but if I combine his numbers also to it, which I will not come to know directly, then the sale of digital is very, very high. Obviously, digital lends us also do lot of\n\nPage 10 of 19",

Why were we doing it\u2026 because we understand that the younger age segment listens to newer music more than the older music, and more importantly, we wanted to keep this company relevant 30 years down the line also. So that people who are 18-year-old today, when they become 40-45 yrs old, they still find the music of Saregama relatable. Unfortunately COVID happened and put all our plans in cold storage because no film releases could happen during this time. Although we had blocked and bought the music of some of the films, the release of these film got pushed by an year.

So we see a very bullish trend on the music front. Carvaan, we will continue with the current trend of controlling costs. Carvaan will not be a loss maker. Carvaan will break even at the worst or turn a very marginal profit, but right now our belief is that Carvaan will at least do a breakeven till the time COVID-19 issue is not completed wiped out.

We sold 15k units in Q1, 81k units in Q2 and 138l is the number that we ended up selling in Q3. yes our numbers are lower than the numbers last year and we are not running away from it. But please keep in mind that it is showing a steady increase inspite of minimal marketing spends. Also, though retail networks have opened the footfalls at the shops are still very low. People are still very wary going to shops for buying white goods. In view of all that, the fact that we sold 138,000 numbers in the October to December timeframe gives us a lot of hope and confidence about the future of Carvaan.\n\nI will again maintain this part very firmly, that the roadmap for Carvaan for the next couple of quarters is, we will keep controlling our expenses. We are relying only on natural customer pull, and not on generating demand through large marketing campaigns. Till the time as a team we are not fully comfortable that the markets have become completely ok, the problems of COVID have completely gone away, which at least 6 or 9 months away, we\n\nPage 5 of 19",

For further Carvaan as we are the owner of the music, all we need to do is due to replace Hindi music by Tamil Music and replace Tamil Music by Punjabi Music or Punjabi Music by Bengali Music or Bengali Music by Marathi Music and then new variant comes out. Similarly, if you got over Carvaan Mini, the content is all sitting out there. It is the very similar concept to what CDs used to be there or cassettes used to be there at one time. You get first Carvaan done after that what music are you putting on it is not such a complicated job and we are realizing that if we are selling in Tamil Nadu makes much more sense to put a music, which is connected to what Tamilians are going to relate to rather than trying to sell Hindi music there. So, our incremental efforts are not very high. I want to give you that comfort here. Also, the way these structures of Carvaan is done, it is very easy for us that if a particular one language Carvaan not moving for us to change it to other language and to pick it in the other market is a very easy job. So we never get stuck with SKUs that are not moving.\n\nDhwanil Desai: Okay and how about marketing because you must have to allocate separate marketing measures for different variants. So will it stretch it?\n\nVikram Mehra: We can specifically this year we have not done any marketing. Earlier also we used to market only the mother brand. Like Carvaan Mini, we have never marketed. We market only the big flagship Carvaan Hindi and everything else were moving right now. Obviously, people come back and say Carvaan Hindi is there anything in our language and there is a product that is sitting there. We do not do individual level variant marketing. It is always the mother brand, which is marketed, when it was being marketed.",

        "text": "Saregama India Limited January 22, 2021\n\nLet me talk about the film business. In the month of July, we got an approval for a film called Comedy Couple and we immediately started the shoot. The film was ready in October and released on Zee5. This is the speed at which things move in Saregama at this moment. From the time the script is conceptualized to getting a greenlight from our partners to completion of production, postproduction and release, it took just three to three and a half months. We have also completed the shoot of a Marathi film Zombivli. Its postproduction is currently going on. We are bullish on the film, and plan to release it in theatres once theatres open up fully.\n\nWhen COVID happened one of our serial Roja was faring at the number 1 position across India on Tamil channels in terms of TRP. Our fear was that with no shoots happening during the lockdown, we will lose our number 1 position. It was unfounded because the movement the new episode started going up, we were back into the number 1 position. Roja and the second serial Chandralekha are not only licensed to Sun TV, but are also released by Saregama on its Youtube and facebook channels. This is the advantage of IP ownership. Once you have IP, you can not only monetize it on its first medium, but there are multiple other ways, in which you can keep on monetizing IP. I have informed you guys in my last quarterly call that for some of our Tamil serials, the Telugu dubbing rights have been licensed out. Some customers even want Telugu remake rights of these serials.\n\nWe were also given the mandate to launch third program of ours on Sun TV during the Q3. Once again our program was conceptualized during lockdown, pitched during lockdown, received a go ahead from Sun TV during the lockdown and got launched during this quarter. The program is called Anbe Vaa. The program has clocking 7 plus ratings in terms of TRPs.",

On a 9month basis PBT crossed Rs 100 crores marks, it is Rs actually Rs 101.63 Crores. The PBT for the entire FY20 was 60cr. Last year is not a good benchmark because Q4 performance suffered badly due to COVID. In response, we had tightened up our all cost heads brutally. We found newer ways to put content out and from Q1 onwards our performance started improving, especially in terms of bottom-line.\n\nOur focus on cash management has continued for the last 3 quarters. A combination of improved collections from all our partners and reduction in expenses. Also, we need to note that one our biggest expenses always remains content cost, primarily music of new films. Since there were no films released in the last 9 months that entire expense has got postponed to either the Q4 of this financial year or most likely the next financial year.\n\nWe had a small debt last year, We are not only debt free now, but also have a cash surplus of close to 150 Crores. We plan to use the same to fund our new content acquisition in future. This is something that we as a management team are extremely proud of.\n\nLet us get into the little more detail about our results in this financial year. The primary driver for the 24% growth in this quarter compared to the previous quarter is coming from higher Carvaan sales compared to the previous quarter and much higher revenue from the TV and the film segment. Both these segments took a beating in the first two quarters on account of Covid, but are now slowly recovering and contributing to both topline and bottomline.",

The next question is from the line of Dhwanil Desai from Turtle Capital, please go ahead.\n\nDhwanil Desai: Vikram just one clarification so on this IPaT order there is one press release from one of the leading radio station who is having 30%-35% market share and their royalty cost will be lesser by 5 Crores to 5.5 Crores while you are saying that if anything that will be better, so there seems some contradiction, so is it largely because they may be acquiring the music less content is that the logical explanation for this?\n\nVikram Mehra: I am unfortunately not able to answer your question. All I can tell you is that in today\u2019s revenues, the contribution from radio is insignificant. Till the time, courts do not clarify the final position, it will be difficult for me to comment on it. I understand which station you are talking about and I also have a feeling why they are telling you their costs are going to come down. I will not like to talk about that in a public forum. All I can give you is the comfort that for Saregama radio revenue today is insignificant. Any delta of 20% here 30% up down is hardly going to make a difference.\n\nDhwanil Desai: Thanks Vikram.\n\nModerator: Thank you, the next question is from the line of Ashwin from Samatva Investments, please go ahead.",

Our aim is that minimum 20% share of the new content getting created in India in this year, should be belonging to us.\n\nHardik Jain: Sir, we spent around 78 Crores last year on advertising in nine months, which was only 25 Crores this year nine months so is there any amount that we have in mind how much we want to spend in advertising?\n\nVikram Mehra: When you look at advertising, there are 4 marketing expenses which are covered under the word advertising. The first is the advertising done for Carvaan; the second is the marketing spends on the new music. When we acquire music of a new film, as part of the commercial arrangement with the film producer, we make a commitment of marketing spends towards promoting the songs. For example we have recently acquired music of a movie called \u201cBell Bottom,\u201d which will belong to Akshay Kumar. As part of the deal, we will pay some amount of money to the producer that we book as content cost and we must guarantee an \u201cx\u201d amount of money to market the music : that is sitting under marketing. So as less content gets released there is no corresponding marketing also getting spent. Third is some amount of marketing that we do for promoting retro content, somebody\u2019s birthday, somebody\u2019s anniversary just to ensure that the retro stars and their music remains top of minds for people. Fourth is every time we are releasing a Yoodlee film of ours, even if it is going straight to a digital platform, we still do some amount of publicity.\n\nHardik Jain: Thank you. Last question Sir. This content cost whatever we spend on acquisition, it will be like written off in the P&L or we capitalize it?",

We are working on a payback period of five years for all the music content that we will be creating or investing. Remember the shelf life of songs in terms of rights is 60 years. For Saregama, the music that we acquired in 70s and 80s is still generating substantial amount of revenue for the company.\n\nManvardhan Baid: Thank you Sir. Best of luck for the future.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Hardik Jain from Whitestone Financial Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nHardik Jain: Good evening Sir. Congratulations for a great result. Sir, just adding on the previous speaker\u2019s question if I am correct, a large part of our library has a shelf life of say 20 years now. So I think the previous speaker who was trying to ask this and even I want to ask this that even if we want to say gather 20% of market share of the song, so in the next 10 or 20 years, we will get gathering around 10000 to 12000 songs and whereas major part of our existing library will come towards the end of the license period so the licence library will the number of songs will shrink at the end of the 20 years?\n\nVikram Mehra: It will not. First remember around 33% or 34% of Saregama\u2019s catalogue belongs to the 21st century, and not with the 20th century. That is one doubt I want to clarify. I do not know what you mean by shelf life for 20 year.\n\nHardik Jain: Sir my understanding is that whatever life that we acquire the license we can charge, or we can generate the revenue from that for 60 years from the day we purchase the license. Is my understanding right first?",

        "text": "Thank\n\nWe at Saregama have a dual focus: increasing the efficiency of the\n\nsystem and investing in newer content. Increasing efficiency is all about ensuring that we can monetize what we own better and at a lower cost structure. I think we have been doing a decent job and this year\u2019s performance is in a way a testament to the fact that our systems and processes are strong and are not individual dependent any longer. The profitability growth by improving the spread of our licensing and reducing our costs has been the great story for us in the financial year 2021 and hopefully will continue in Q4 also. But the second part is an equally important part, which we have not done because of COVID, which is to invest enough in newer content; thus helping the company not only increase its revenue in a multifold fashion but also prepare itself for the next 30 years also. This year unfortunately or fortunately, the efficiency gave us benefits; the investments did not happen, so the numbers are looking very, very good. Going forward what we assure you that the efficiency part is going to remain as robust. This is not a one off thing. We are maintaining our guidance on music licensing growing upwards of 20%. Carvaan will remain at a breakeven number, if not positive, as we go forward, but we will continue with the cautious approach on Carvaan. The Films business will be growing at anything between 14% and 17% year-on-year. Hopefully, future is going to be even brighter than this. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.\n\nPage 18 of 19\n\nSaregama India Limited January 22, 2021\n\nModerator:\n\nThank you. On behalf of ICICI Securities we conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for joining us.

There was a pressure building up on us. Negotiation proposition was not in our favor. With our films trending on Netflix, film after film has performed very, very well on the platforms. Our ability to get the right price for the quality content that we are producing is getting established, which is helping the margins of this business. Also remember as we people go forward, the first round of films that are licensed, the ones that were licensed for three years or four years, which have been fully written off in our books now. I want to come back and fresh licensing is going to be happening. All that will start adding up. We are projecting right now anything between 14% to 16% topline growth on Yoodlee part of the business year-on-year.\n\nAnkit: Sir, basically both topline and margins should increase primarily because of introducing bargaining power as well as know the new licenses renewed for the old movies that we have?\n\nVikram Mehra: Other parts I missed this time that you will see in next financial year we people also getting into the world of series rather than limiting ourselves only in films, all digital. We are getting into Hindi TV serials. This is bigger than launch one big film, can you do a big series, which six episodes and each of the episode literally turn into a film.\n\nAnkit: Sir any success for not getting some licensing over there?\n\nVikram Mehra: We will announce it at the right time. We are very hopeful.\n\nAnkit:",

Can you go a little slow and ask again please?\n\nAshwin: While in the last one year, topline has grown and the streaming revenues have increased, the royalty expense has come down in absolute terms. The royalty expenses so how should we think about the royalty expense going ahead?\n\nVikram Mehra: The content cost is also sitting in Royalty. If you are not buying new content, this year we hardly bought any content. That is the point that other speakers that asked me. This year is a combination of we people doing very good on efficiencies, but also postponing all our expenses because there were no music getting released. Hence you see the royalty what is sitting on the royalty low. That number will go up. We are investing in new content. The intent is very, very clear. We want to invest in new content aggressively.\n\nAshwin:\n\nThank you so much.\n\nModerator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that was the last question for the day. I would now like to hand over the conference back to the management for their closing comments.\n\nVikram Mehra:",
