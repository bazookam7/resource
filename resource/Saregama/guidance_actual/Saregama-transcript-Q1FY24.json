We have 2 big original songs in Hindi coming out sung by Arijit and Badshah. So we have a pretty decent lineup in front of us for Q2. And if I look at Q3, Q4, the second half of the year, which is always bigger from the entertainment industry perspective, we have big movies coming up. In Tamil we have Captain Miller and Kanguva, \u2013 starring Dhanush and Surya respectively, both of them top stars of Tamil. Their movies\u2019 music is going to get released.\n\nKiccha Sudeep, who is the number 1 star of Kannada, his movie\u2019s music is getting released in the later part of the year. In Hindi, we again have, , the Vicky Kaushal movie Mere Mehboob Mere Sanam, we have A. R. Rahman music in Imtiaz Ali and Diljit Dosanjh's Chamkila, and then we have Ajay Devgn's Maidaan. In Malayalam, we have the Mammootty movie Bazooka, in Punjabi, we have a very big Gippy film coming up - Warning 2, the music of all these films is sitting out there with us.\n\nSo we go forward with leadership position. Now that we have got on to this number 1 position. we see ourselves fully holding on to this position. Also strategically, I need to state this, it's easy for us to take a conservative position on newer content and just take a few movies here and there from the new content perspective. As a company, we don't believe in that policy. Saregama as the erstwhile HMV had always bought the biggest music, and this is what has kept company relevant for so many years.",

Discussions with the party are in pretty advanced stage. And based on the conservative policy that we follow, we have provided for an estimated settlement amount in our books during Q1. This is the only reason why there has been an increase in the other expenses in the P&L. And this has absolutely nothing to do with the ongoing business operations of the company. This is a very old legal case that's going on.\n\nThe big story in the music business for us in this quarter is achieving the leadership position in the Hindi music segment . While last year, we were able to get into a leadership position on Telugu, Malayalam, Bhojpuri and Gujarati, Hindi was still some time far away because most of our releases have got postponed to financial year '23, '24. Two of them finally got released in Q1, with few songs beings released now.\n\nSo in Q1, the biggest hits of the country at an all-India level have been the 2 songs of Zara Hatke Zara Bachke, a Vicky Kaushal, Sara Ali Khan film for which the music was given by Sachin- Jigar. The song \u201cTere Vaaste\u201d was there at the number 1 position on every possible chart in India, whether it's Spotify or it's Airtel Wynk. In fact, on YouTube, it was a global number 1 music video for a very, very long time. The songs are also rating at number 1 on various radio stations, whether it's in terms of number of times songs are played or the local countdowns, which is presented by a company like Mirchi. Even on Shazam, it was emerging as the top song.\n\nSo the music has done very well for us. It was immediately followed by Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani. One song got released at the end of the last quarter and did very, very well -- it is an Arijit Singh song.",

And when it moves to a subscription, our yield per song heard is going to go up. I've shared the math multiple times in various calls. So I won't bore you by repeating how that will work. But as we move towards subscription, there will be short-term pain. As platforms move from a free model to going behind completely a paid model, their revenues are also going to fall for a quarter or 2 quarters, and so there will be an impact coming on our revenues too.\n\nThe good part is when you are a very well-diversified company like Saregama, which has a very limited dependence on revenues coming from streaming, we will be able to manage these ups and downs that will keep on happening on the subscription revenue in the short term very easily. We are, though we are sharing with you that there will be pressures coming in on the subscription side, still holding on to our guidance that overall music licensing revenue should be growing at the rate of anything around 22% - 23% this year. We don't see that changing.\n\nThe YouTube revenues have gone up substantially. And for us, it's disproportionately higher numbers that are coming in. Remember, traditionally, the music that we people own, we had only the audio rights. We are the only label who had only audio rights and not the video rights. Now with the aggression that we people are showing and picking up newer content, all this content is coming along with the video rights here.\n\nIf you check out all-India trending on YouTube at any particular time, out of the 20, 30 songs that they show on the all-India trending list, we typically, as a label, have anything between 7 to 10 songs sitting in that particular list and it also has a direct implication on the revenues that we are making right now from the video side.",

Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani\u2019s, next lineup of songs have come out, all doing very, very well.

So that you or I may not be there, but you as a shareholder and whichever management team is sitting here in 2060 also can take a lot of pride in the content that we people secured in 2020. We take pride in the content that was picked up in '50s and '60s and '70s, and we still make money off it.\n\nOn the monetization side, I have been saying this for some time that the big change that is happening is about more and more streaming platforms now realizing that they need to move towards a subscription model. You already have 3 streaming platforms, all announcing over the last 90 to 100 days that the model is now fully moving behind the paid wall. There are only 3 platforms - which are number 1, number 2, number 3 in the market - left who are still pursuing a free model, . All 3 of them have sent a clear message that they want to move towards a subscription model.\n\nAm I saying India will never have a free market? It will be silly on my part to go and state that. India will be a mix, like in television business, of subscription and advertising. But just like in the television business when at one time subscription was just a nominal number and all the revenues of TV channels used to come from advertising which has now completely changed, and a larger chunk now starts coming from subscription, something very similar is going to be happening in India on the music side too.",

        "text": "Vikram Mehra:\n\nThank you, and good afternoon to everyone. The biggest event of the last quarter was the approval from NCLT for the demerger of Digidrive Distributors Limited. This new company now has the digital distribution mandate on a nonexclusive basis for the Carvaan range of products , Open Media\u2019s publication business and Saregama's other noncore assets. We are in the process of getting this new company listed on the Stock Exchanges.\n\nThe shareholders of Saregama will get one share of Digidrive for every five shares of Saregama held by them and the record date for the same was 27 July 2023. We expect the listing to be done somewhere in the last week of August '23.\n\nThe quarter saw operating revenue of INR163 crores and a PBT of INR59 crores. In our presentation, we have again shared the performance of the company over the last 13 quarters, just to show you the cyclical trend that we have seen in Saregama all throughout, where Q1 is the lowest quarter and Q3 is the highest quarter. The same trend is continuing year after year after year. And we hope that we will further build up on the quarter 1 number in quarter 2 and quarter 3.\n\nIf we look at the quarter numbers on a year-on-year basis, the revenue appears on the flattish side, but it hides more than it tells. It's the events business, which is extremely cyclical and event dependent, where last year we had a large number of Diljit Dosanjh concerts that were scheduled in U.S. and Canada in the first quarter of the year, which was not the case this year. This year, in fact, we have Australia concerts being scheduled in the later part of the year. So the Q1 number of events, which were there in the last financial year were not there this year. Otherwise, if you look at the music business, there was a pretty healthy growth of 17% in Q1 too.",

We are not dependent on any one player, any one business stream and, within that also, any one partner too much. There was a time that some of our global partners were having a problem in terms of their advertising revenues. We were not that affected because our dependence on any one partner is not that high. Now that all of them are seeing an upswing, hopefully it's great news for us. But the good part is, there isn't too much dependence on any one partner. We are not tied to the fortunes of any global MNC.\n\nOn Carvaan, we have been stating this, that it's running on its own momentum, and the journey continued during this quarter also. If I look at a quarter-on-quarter basis, it's been a crazy growth that we have seen. It's a 50% growth. We have touched close to 1.49 lakh units being sold. This compared to around 90,000 that we sold in the Q1 last year.\n\nThe big sales drivers continue to be Carvaan Mini and Carvaan Mobile, which is also explaining that the revenue growth is lower than the unit growth. But remember, Carvaan is profitable, and not making losses. And more importantly, Carvaan helps us a lot on the catalog marketing side. It really keeps that music relevant as we people go forward.\n\nFilms and series vertical did not have any release happening during the quarter. We just had the TV serials on Sun TV. Q1 is traditionally our weaker quarter from an advertising perspective because most advertising goes into IPL. So in Q1 every year, we go through the same pressure. This quarter was no different. We have one movie of ours, which is getting released in Q2. For Q3, Q4, the lineup is very strong. There are lots of big titles that are coming, both on the Malayalam and Punjabi side.",

But due to this factor, do you think the lack of releases in maybe 1 or 2 quarters, which you may have done deliberately, will affect the revenues going forward since they form a huge part of our revenue? Is this something that we should expect going forward?\n\nVikram Mehra:\n\nYes, it is. So the only part of films and TV segment, I don't like is a lumpy behaviour. Often the film's release date is -- may not even be in my hand. It also depends a lot right now, which is the right window where we can go and release our film so that there is no competing film that is of a bigger star coming on the same day. So a lot of variables start playing. So you will have some amount of lumpiness. Our hope is as the size of films and TV business becomes bigger, there should not be any quarter where there is no release coming in. We are hoping and trying that it builds up that way. But the very nature of it is lumpy.\n\nUdhayaprakash: Okay. If I could squeeze in one last question. And on last con-call, you had stated that we are remaining conservative about spending QIP money because any time you go on for acquisitions, the valuations are so inflated. Is this still continuing? Are you trying to finalize any deals during this financial year...\n\nVikram Mehra: No, we are very clear, we will do deals either in terms of content buying or buying positions in companies that help us in the marketing of music because the money is going to be used only for music. It's not going to be used for films business or Carvaan business. We will do it only when we believe it is value accretive to our investors. If it's not value accretive to our investors, then we need -- we sit on the fund or use these funds for new content acquisition rather than going out there on the catalog side. Are we in dialogue? We are in dialogue with people. And",

Looking at the Q1 numbers, some of you may have doubts, how you're going to go and achieve it. We are very confident with the lineup, which is sitting in Q3 and Q4 that on an annual basis, we will achieve the 25% revenue growth number with the 15% margin.\n\nLet me now talk about the live events business based on the feedback received from multiple investors. We have presented live events business as a separate vertical, carved out of the films and television segment, so that you can see the revenue and profits.\n\nPlease remember, it\u2019s an absolutely new vertical for us. It will require large amount of investments to build it up. We saw in this quarter, Disco Dancer being released for the first time in India. Some of you may have heard about it as it was widely covered in every major newspaper and online publication. It got very positive reviews both from the critics side as well as the customer side.\n\nI have to be honest with you, we had to market it a lot because it is the first time a concept like a musical show where our story is being told with the combination of dialogues and music being presented in India. Its a relatively newer concept for the Indian audience. We are either used to seeing a story in the form of a film in a theatre or we go to the musical theatre only to listen to people singing songs. This is a combination we have, which is a very common thing in U.S. or U.K. It's a newer concept in India, and we spent a good amount of money to go and promote it.",

Until now, brands use to have their advertising and they used to have a song in their advertising. Now we are proactively going to the brands and saying, why not we develop a song which is completely suited to their brand, which helps them in their marketing while we can also go out there and monetize that song. And in fact, we also get a license fee from the brand. More and more brands are realizing that to talk to the youth music is the strongest art form. And with our leadership position and perception in the market, brands are very comfortable coming out and working with us.\n\nOur work on growing revenue from our catalog continues. This means more and more low-fi versions or trap mix versions, acoustic versions are released. This is the kind of music that resonates with the newer generation . While we maintain the lyrical quality or the composition of the original song, it's a completely new instrumentation, which is created at times literally at a zero cost or a very nominal cost, making the song relevant to the younger generation and, more importantly, giving a fresh lease of life from the copyright perspective to the new rendition of the song that we release.\n\nWe also continued with the campaign to keep on inviting more and more entries from budding talent, whether it's a bathroom singer or it's a talented guy who has won a contest in a smaller",

That's an internal guideline that we people to work with. And at this juncture, the number is closer to 12%. So we still have a large elbow room left in front of us.

Music segment is solid. Overall, if the growth looks flat, it's only because live events had a big quarter last year in Q1.

This is allowing us once again us to grow revenues without spending money and also to improve the popularity of our catalog music.\n\nOn the last call, we have shared that the royalty expenses that went up in Q4 was a one-off event because we had adjusted the entire royalty payout that we had to make to singers for the entire year in a single quarter. We have lived up to our commitment. If you see the royalty expenses this year as a percentage of revenue, they have come down. And this is a steady state in which we are going to be operating, because now we are paying them on every quarter basis and will not come across on a cumulative annual basis . So royalties are back to where they are supposed to be.\n\nOn an overall basis, I still maintain, we have just touched the tip of the iceberg. We are not going to get swayed by doing some short-term things to improve profitability for a quarter or 2. We will continue taking steps to build the foundation for this company to be the most relevant entertainment company in India for the next 50 years. All the necessary steps, whether in terms of spends that we people are doing on data analytics, predictive AI, generative AI building tools for us on the marketing side, we will continue taking those steps because we believe that's going to make this company far more resilient and powerful in the decades to come on not just the music front, but on the overall entertainment front.",

        "text": "Coming to the first part, music licensing revenue has shown a pretty decent growth. We show these segments separately only at the end of the year. However tempted I may be right now to share the numbers with you to tell you the growth is pretty decent, I will resist it. We are holding on to our projection of 23% growth overall on the music licensing side. We have said this over the last 4 to 5 years, we have a track record that we have maintained these numbers, and I'm pretty confident we'll maintain the numbers this year also.\n\nSwapnil Potdukhe:\n\nRight. And the second question that I wanted to ask is the losses or the cash burn that we expect in the Events business. Have we internally taken -- do you have any number in mind that you would burn a certain amount of? You did mention that it will take around 12 to 18 months to be profitable, but any quantification in terms of actual burn that we're expecting in that period.\n\nVikram Mehra:\n\nHave we got an internal number that we people are saying that at any particular time should not go beyond that, yes, we have a plan which is being adhered to. But for you the comfort I can say that, this cost is factored when we share the adjusted EBITDA margin. The adjusted EBITDA margin at the company level is not going to be falling below 32% to 33% that we have always maintained.\n\nSee the live events business, strategically is also critical for us. We want to control the artist, and for the artist live event is a very important part. As a company, are clear that we are not relying only on, firstly, the laurels of our past by doing only recreations of older music. We want to create music for tomorrow. Tomorrow\u2019s music is going to come both from film and non-film side and the newer generation is getting more and more comfortable with non-film original music, the way it happens in America or anywhere else.\n\nPage 8 of 18\n\nsa Vega majl\n\nSaregama India Limited July 28, 2023",

        "text": "Vikram Mehra:\n\nSaregama India Limited July 28, 2023\n\nSo I just have a couple of questions. One is with respect to your growth rate in the music licensing business. Your music business has grown 17%. Your volumes in the Carvaan business have grown more than 50%. Does that imply that our music licensing business has grown significantly lower than 17% Y-o-Y? And if that is so, and the fact that some of our accounts are doing quite well, topping some of the charts, why is that not getting reflected in terms of our top line growth in this licensing business?\n\nLet me answer your second question first so that you understand how the commercial works in the music licensing business. These are not the days of CDs and cassettes that an album becomes a hit right now I can sell more cassettes and CDs. Most of our deals are covered under minimum guarantees and the overflows are booked only when the deal gets over.\n\nSo unless a deal was getting over on the 29th or 30th of June and the overflows have hit us, there's no way that the impact of success of a song in quarter 1 can be seen in quarter 1 alone. You will see it only when the overflows at the end of the deal are going to kick in. Or if it\u2019s a fixed fee deal, then basis higher performance we will be able to negotiate a much higher fixed fee at the time of renewal. So there is no immediate same-day correlation or a causal effect relationship, wherein the success of the song today results in the revenue going up also today, principally.",

One, we want to have a guarantee that 70% to 80% of the cost of the film is revenue connected so that is guaranteed before the theatrical release. That's an important criteria with which we people approach the film business. We rely on theatrical only for 20% to 30% of the cost of the film. When a film is put on theatrical release, we know that if even if everything goes wrong , at least anything between 70% to 80% of the cost is recovered.\n\nSecond, we are looking at a 15% margin in this business minimum. We look at these 2 parameters, then the languages like Malayalam, Punjabi, in fact, to some extent, Tamil and Telugu also fit the bill better. There is a higher probability that the films get over on time within budgets, and we are able to get a good value for those films, but are we open to other projects also? Yes, we are, provided the other project also guarantee us that 70% to 80% of the cost of the film will get -- the revenue connected to that is guaranteed even before we start spending the money. That's our basic principle in which we approach our films business. We are not relying too much on theatre.\n\nModerator: The next question comes from the line of Aditya Nahar from Alpna Enterprises.\n\nAditya Nahar: Vikram, just wanted to check with you this provision that we have made against a settlement, if you could share what the amount of this is?\n\nVikram Mehra: See the matter, at this juncture, being sub-judice, and still pending a formal closure, we cannot give you more details at this juncture. And I'm quite hopeful right now that in Q2, everything should get closed, and that's the time we'll share with you.\n\nModerator: The next question comes from the line of Ravi Kumar Naredi from Naredi Investments Private Limited.",

I think for this year, we have planned only 3 releases. So what would be the plan for the number of films per year down the line 3, 4 years?\n\nVikram Mehra: So I'll not go on the number of films. I will go back on the revenue that we are writing on film production. This year, we are seeing right now, we should be growing at around 25% in that segment. And in fact, I'm holding on to that guidance on a short- to medium-term basis. Every year, we see our films and TV business growing at 25%, while the total capital allocation will always be maintained within the upper limit of 18%.\n\nBala Krishna: Okay. That's great. And regarding this, the library, we have around 68 films or 70 films, so all these films satellite rights are already sold or any film's satellite rights are still pending, we can expect any monetization from that?\n\nVikram Mehra: So there's a combination. For the newer films, most of the rights are gone. For some of the older films, rights come back to us because we sell only time duration based rights. We are licensing and not selling. So often, if satellite rights go away after 10 years, they come back. So this keeps on happening. The bigger revenue clearly is connected to the newer films, and most of the newer films are still going through the first tranche of licensing.\n\nPage 11 of 18\n\nsa Vega majl\n\nBala Krishna:\n\nSaregama India Limited July 28, 2023\n\nSo when we can expect these newer films will come back to also again rights, which we can...",

But what I'm assuring you that\n\nPage 13 of 18\n\nsa Vega majl\n\nSaregama India Limited July 28, 2023\n\nthis money is invested right now, keeping in mind principle being secured and will not be used for anything apart from music.\n\nCA Garvit Goyal: So that thing I understand, but if I remember correctly, 1.5 years ago, our strategy was that most of the funds, most of the percentage of this fund will be used for inorganic acquisition side. So that thing, I think, we are something differentiating now....\n\nVikram Mehra: We believe that if any acquisition is going to be value accretive, we will go ahead. We have done a smaller acquisition right in the beginning. After that, we are still evaluating multiple players, both on the content side and marketing side. The moment we believe that something is ticking mark and its value accretive to the investors, we will take it up.\n\nCA Garvit Goyal: And last one, you were saying this year, we will announce something regarding the share. If we are not getting 100%, we will get some percentage of the company between these terms. So is it likely to happen in this year?\n\nVikram Mehra: Let me do some research, then I'll share with you.\n\nModerator: The next question comes from the line of Navneet Bhaiya an individual investor. .\n\nNavneet Bhaiya: I have 3 questions. The first is the INR0.10 that you get per song that is heard on a YouTube channel or whichever channel, does that ever come for renegotiation, with inflation or maybe cost of content also going up? Or that remains fixed forever?",

The yield will go up because more and more people are going to go behind the paid wall. And if they go behind a paid wall, this yield can become 2.5 to 5x higher on a per song heard basis for the guys who are listening to the song behind the paid wall. But on the free side, I don't see this yield going up. The real kicker is coming because of the deeper penetration of each of these services and more number of songs being heard on a daily basis.\n\nNavneet Bhaiya: Okay. So again, on the free side, any specific reason why couldn\u2019t work, inflation per annum at least that should be there in the fee...\n\nVikram Mehra: Navneet, I have shared this in the past also, remember, on the free side, the streaming platforms don't have a viable business model today. The only way they can make money is through advertising. There is a limited amount of advertising money that chases audio. So the streaming companies, if they are promoting free, they also need to find a way to make money. And we understand those pressures. That's why world over in every country of the world streaming platforms can move towards the paid side. You have 600 million paid subscribers for audio streaming world over.\n\nIn India, we have seen that video streaming has done a decent enough job on the paid side. It is just a matter of time, all these streaming companies in India are also going to have a very effective paid business, they make money and we make money.\n\nPage 14 of 18\n\nsa Vega majl\n\nNavneet Bhaiya:\n\nSaregama India Limited July 28, 2023\n\nUnderstood.

So we looked at our global benchmarks, the companies we look up to and all of them follow a similar policy.\n\nOn an overall basis, to give you an idea that for a song, which is getting released, the numbers, assuming marketing to be 20% of the cost, 36% of the total money gets written off in year 1 itself.\n\nAnirudh Shetty: Got it. And in the past, we have mentioned that we look to make a payback of 5 years. So how should one interpret that? Is it that the cash that we'll deploy in any particular given song or a particular year that we intend to recover that on a post-tax basis over time? How does one read this payback period?\n\nVikram Mehra: See this payback is without including the cost of capital. If the amount of money spent to acquire content is hundred dollars, we are charging it off along with marketing at around 48% out in the first 2 years. But we internally work on a benchmark that this hundred dollars will get recovered in the first 60 months.\n\nAnirudh Shetty: Got it. And if, say, over time, in the streaming world, you move for more free to paid subscription, does the payback period reflect that new reality? Or do you think the payback period could become even shorter if that were to happen?\n\nVikram Mehra: All my growth projections, 23% on the music growth with the 32% to 33% adjusted EBITDA at the company level, all of them are shared with you without considering the upside that will come from paid subscription.\n\nModerator: Thank you.

Let's be clear that in the Bombays and Delhis of the world, the youngsters also listen to a lot of Western music or Korean music for that matter. But it's still -- even with those people who are here, every time they're with their friends and there's a party happening, finally, it's going to come back to Arijit Singh and Badshah or a Ranbir Kapoor or a Ranvir Singh movie fan. The moment you go to smaller towns, it's all Indian music.\n\nNavneet Bhaiya: Okay. So as of now, for us, as a company, even in the medium term, there would be no plans of acquiring content in the English segment, right?\n\nVikram Mehra: So we have a very publicly stated position there that we believe with 1.4 billion Indians here and a large amount of 1.4 billion Indians , the entire population of Srilanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan is a large enough captive market and parts of Malaysia on the Tamil side and parts of Singapore, there is a large enough population right now for our music. And we want to focus there and get a clear distinct number 1 position.\n\nNavneet Bhaiya: Understood. And the third question, which is more of an understanding. So there are a lot of user created mash of songs, which is like a 3-minute songs with 10 different songs in it, of which maybe they have 3 from Saregama, the remaining from some other labels. How does the revenue sharing work there?\n\nVikram Mehra: So tell me there, it all depends platform to platform. Give me an example. Are you talking about YouTube?\n\nNavneet Bhaiya: Yes, YouTube. They are...\n\nVikram Mehra: In YouTube, if somebody is going and running a video where 5 songs are being used, the revenue which is getting generated that YouTube is going to share with us, will be split across the 5 songs.\n\nNavneet Bhaiya: Okay. Understood. And you would have an analytic to figure out as when a song is used for 50% of the time, yes?",
