    "text": "Vikram Mehra:\n\nspite of all the tough environment that we people have faced like every other company the good news is that we have been able to grow profit this quarter. Although our topline came down because of Carvaan retail not happening and we not being able to shoot episodes for our TV serials on Sun TV, our PAT as Rs.15.76 Crores at consolidated level where the decent growth over a loss of Rs.1.24 Crores same quarter last year and even compared to Q4 we improved our PAT numbers by a crore or so. As much as profits is great news to us now what makes us very, very happy is to see how our music and films have grown in popularity and usage during this quarter. So April was a tough month when there was an immediate kneejerk reaction coming from consumers and we could see that the streaming numbers, YouTube number everything was going down, but eventually from May onwards we have seen a rapid growth coming in these numbers and both films and music have done very well for us.\n\nWith consumer sitting at home primary during the April, May, June timeframe most companies have suffered due to lockdown, because lockdown means lower consumption of their products. Saregama by the virtue of the fact that we own content IP, we have been able to do much better in this quarter compared to other companies because if you are sitting at home, you are doing something and what are you doing either listening to music or watching lots of content on digital platforms both ways right now it means you will end up consuming the Saregama content. What we clearly saw this time that more people consume content and they consume for longer duration per day compared to the previous quarter which means more and more of our music and films and TV serials got consumed in this quarter.\n\nPage 2 of 30",

    "text": "August 03, 2020\n\nOur big initiatives right now apart from driving for profits is the beginning of this quarter since COVID that already hit in March, our management team was very clear about the SAR that we have to preserve cash and we need to do everything possible right now so that our cash reserves go off to take care of any eventuality. This meant that we had to improve our selections and spending have to come down dramatically. I am happy to say not only during this quarter have we repaid debt of Rs.6.1 Crores, not only have we taken care of all our SAR issues, which I will talk about after this, but we also reduced the working capital by Rs.35.6 Crores, which means we are ending our quarter at a consolidated level with Rs.45 Crores cash with us. By all benchmark this goes a long way to show you right now that how particular we were during this period on cash management. The long issue which has come from all the investors has been issue of stock appreciation rights or SAR, I am happy to announce right now that 100% of the SAR have been canceled right now. So there is no concept of SAR any longer in the company, everything has been converted into ESOP because of the accounting policies we had taken the hit of Rs.1.3 Crores in this quarter on account of SAR moving to ESOP and there was another right off that we will have to take on the range of around a crore over the next three quarters, but this is the end of the chapter of SAR as far as Saregama is concerned.",

    "text": "So overall a great quarter but do keep in mind the cost elements in this quarter were kind of a one-off because the content cost for this quarter was practically zero. We have not gone out there and procured any high-profile content this quarter because all production has come to a standstill. This is not something right now, which is going to get repeated in the quarters to come. Revenues lines will keep on improving as we keep on moving from the first quarter to second to third, but there will be content cost that will also start coming in to prepare the company for future.\n\nLet me get into detail part, we had been mentioning this right now on multiple calls that the biggest growth driver that we see within the company is the music licensing business. We were a content IP company and we continue being a content IP company. Everything else right now is a way to ensure that we monetize our IP better, but our focus always has been to build IP and monetize IP. As the digital consumption is going up globally more people are consuming content right now through streaming platforms, whether it is video streaming, audio streaming or social media or video sharing sites as more and more people consume content on that, higher is our content consumption which means our revenue straightaway starts going up. The good thing which has happened over the last three years that is popularity of Carvaan which is an altogether different business that we have started out here has helped a lot in bringing attention and focused back onto retro music. Retro music is suddenly live once again courtesy we work on Carvaan is a very cool thing to go back in hear. Let us take an example of there was a series that got recently launched on\n\nPage 3 of 30",

    "text": "August 03, 2020\n\nDisney Hotstar called Aarya which is Sushmita Sen series. If you see that there are 32 instances of Saregama music getting used in that program. In fact, the lead song of the entire series, which is very, very popular is Bade Acche Lagte Hai. All this is a proof right now the retro is again becoming very, very cool, this is the work we have done earnestly over the last few years and Carvaan does a lot. Our licensing deals with Spotify and Facebook finally got operational this quarter so we are seeing the revenue impact of that also. We overall now have our licensing done to 45 different music streaming applications in India and abroad almost all leading television channels in India, all the popular video sharing apps whether it is YouTube or it is Facebook or Instagram or it is TikTok our deals are there everywhere and our content is being used by primarily all big video OTT apps so Netflix has lot of series that uses our content, Amazon, Hotstar, ALT Balaji almost all of them the programming that they carry ends up using our songs somewhere in the film and series. The only part of the licensing business which got affected immediately was public performance. Revenue with no parties happening, no functions happening clearly that business is taking a hit. There was no impact on this quarter because Q1 typically is not quarter in which we end up getting revenues from society's for public performance, but in the long run if the current problem of Corona continues, you will have an impact on public performance revenue. Thankfully for us that is not a very big share of overall licensing revenue.",

    "text": "We had taken this call around four years back to ensure that every piece of content that we own is fully digitized and we have rich metadata behind it. We continued with this exercise right now in this quarter, released another 11,000 songs that means our catalog has gone up by 10% in a single quarter these are great old retro songs of ours right now, which we always owned for which digitization work has got over right now which makes a library richer by 10%. We have also constantly investing in newer content. The interesting fact, which we have also shared an annual report in that 30% of the total revenue that we make out the music licensing, 30% of that comes from the music that people have acquired in the 21st century, only 70% now comes from the music as required in the 20th century. So while we are doing a great job right now monetizing our retro content are investment strategy of investing in newer content seems to be paying off.\n\nWe are also now planning to continue with this. You will see us investing heavily in regional content as we go forward. All the data that we people have consumer research done by us and the data which is coming out there from the TV channels, publication business, movie business indicates that there is an upsurge in the entertainment consumption in regional languages. So you have that much more Bojpuri, Gujarati, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu content getting consumed. We are aggressively going ahead and creating content or acquiring content in many of these regional languages of India. This goes hand in hand\n\nPage 4 of 30",

This year the focus will continue on Gujarati, Tamil, Bhojpuri Punjabi music non-film music being invested into by us. We in this quarter also ended up releasing lot of cover versions performed from original music. The strategy was a very clear they will be content investment which was close to zero. All these deals we convinced the artist sitting at home to create music from the comfort of his or her home and the only investment from our side was marketing and not on content and that has helped us a lot. Our overall YouTube base has gone up, us following on all the video sharing apps like Instagram, Facebook, Tiktok everywhere we find upsurge in the number of followers for Saregama. As we continue our journey right now of investing more and more in content because that is the key part as we go ahead.",

Till now the content within the company was bought in two different fashions and the charging dependent on the acquisition structure of content. Film music typically gets acquired on the basis of perpetual royalty and in advance so if I am buying music of film x I may end up paying right now 1 Crores advance and may get into a royalty deal of X person so the way it works is once I recover the entire advance I have given and the revenues cross the hurdle rate then the people end up seeing the producer in perpetuity and X person royalty. These kinds of deals the way they work us that the marketing cost was charged immediately on the marketing cost is typically 20% so I am paying Rs.100 for a movie typically Rs.20 goes towards marketing and Rs.80 goes to the producer. So Rs.20 were charged of immediately and Rs.80 were getting charged off over a period of four years. The music that we were buying outright means where there was no royalty, we were doing onetime payment this is typically non-filmy music. In that case we had been charging it out over a period of 10 years. Since majority of our content cost for all filmy music, so the majority was sitting on four years and 10 part were not coming in action in a very big fashion. In both cases as I said marketing costs were always getting charged off in the year one itself so all this we debating on that Rs.80 of cost Rs.20 rupees marketing get charged of immediately. So filmy case Rs.80 were getting charged off over eight four years non filmy case over 10 years this is how Saregama have been charging off its content cost over the last decade or so. We are not saying that since we will be investing so heavily now in nonfilm music also, we decided as a management team that this discretionary path we want to take it away and depending\n\nPage 5 of 30",

This will be applicable only on content that we have acquired or will be acquiring post 1st April 2020. In this quarter there have been literally no impact on account of this change in accounting policy because we acquired hardly no content in this quarter but as we go forward, they will be an impact since they will be large amount of non-filmy music also that will be bought. We believe right now this impact hopefully neutralize each other, but the key part is acquisition structure in no longer going to be dependent on what we charge in methodology going to be.",

The sales have been shut primarily because the retail network was closed for entire month of April and May even e-commerce was shut for the majority of the quarter and even when it started right now it was during delivery in select pincodes only. We actually restarted the selling process of Carvaan only in mid of June onwards we sold on 15,000 units only during this period. The focus as I had mentioned the during the March investor call was to reduce our manpower cost and marketing costs dramatically during this quarter and I am happy to say that we were able to manage this, we cut down our manpower a lot during this period and above the line marketing was brought down to literally zero. The only marketing expenses that continue were the work that we are doing with the various agencies so we have media buying agencies, creative agency is a more on the retainer basis so you do not throw them out on a month-on-month basis, but all the discretionary part of marketing was taken off. As we look at future now we realized that even if the vaccine coming in for COVID-19, you will see the elderly staying at home for at least next 12 to 18 months period, people above the age of 60 are in general being recommended by government and by all agencies to play safe and stay at home. Remember staying at home is not an easy task. People who have stayed at home for four months realized that the boredom starts killing you. There is always a fight right now for the television set because children are also at home these days. So, we believe there will be upsurge for a product like Carvaan which allows people above the age of 60 which are stuck at home to go and entertain themselves without being dependent on anybody else. Irrespective of that our focus that I had committed earlier remains that we will not be doing any marketing push this year. That\n\nPage 6 of 30",

    "text": "August 03, 2020\n\nentire sale of Carvaan will be dependent on the natural pull that comes out because it is just too scary to carry out any marketing campaigns because if the next set of lockdown comes in 15 days, we do not want our money to get wasted. So this year our strategy on Carvaan is rely completely on natural consumer pull, bring your cost structure down to the minimal out here and wait for things to stabilize hopefully by next year things will stabilize and that is the time we go back in terms of aggressively pushing Carvaan, but the key part which we are solidified during this quarter also is the transition which is happening from Carvaan as a product which used to give one time margin to Carvaan platform which is targeted at middle age people of India people above the age of 35 and 40 giving them not just music but podcast and which we believe will be able to generate advertising revenue for us in a period of 18 to 24 months. So the good part at that time will be not only will we make money when you sell Carvaan, we should also be able to generate advertising on maybe subscription revenue from a large base of consumers who will be having a next generation Carvaan, which we call Carvaan platform.",

Did it hurt us financially, yes it did, it hurt us both from the topline and bottom-line perspective because no new content could be put up. We had a bunch of people right now who were there with us on payroll of the company not contributing, but the good part is this period of three months allowed us to start monetizing the existing IP of our Tamil serial. We always as telling you right now that we have 6,000 hours of content sitting on Tamil serials and this one of these quarters right now where we were able to go back and set this IP so couple of deals happen right now of two of our serials where people got either remake rights or dubbing rights of a serial for new content. We started pushing our older episodes of the serials aggressively on YouTube, and now we are realizing some of the episode are crossing two million number that means additional source of revenue started coming in for us from the older episodes of older serials. We believe right now and as things progresses and the new episodes keep on coming back this learning of how to go back and make money from the older episodes will come in very handy for us.",

Licensing was very, very solid, films was very solid and Carvaan and TV serials because the market was shut could not do much but we ensured through prudent cost management and growing our revenues our licensing that overall, this quarter went very well.

Please go ahead.\n\nAdithya Nagar: Just wanted to comment on your disclosures for the quarter I hope you continue to publish the balance sheet and cash flow every quarter, you have set a pretty good standard. My question Vikram is about shooting permissions I believe that some movies have been allowed to start shooting in Bombay itself when do you think that we can get back to 40%, 50%, 60% schedule for our movies?\n\nVikram Mehra: For us right now we have started shoots of two of films and Tamil serials in the month of July. Our Tamil serials the first eight episodes are already out and broadcasting today so their life has come back to normalcy for both our serials. Our first film we already completed the first schedule. We are moving to the second schedule at this juncture everything is business as usual for us in a month of July.\n\nAdithya Nagar: Alright great. Thank you so much.\n\nModerator: Thank you.

They are very connected areas to each other. They are not very different areas of music or films or TV series. What we are very clear we are not getting into launching our Netflix equivalent app or a Ghana or Sarvan equivalent applications. We have no intentions of doing that. We will remain up of pure play content IP company. The only other area right on that we people are looking at for a direct and this is going to be a B2B business the only area we want to get into directly with the consumer is the Carvaan platform. Carvaan has got positioned very well over the last three years as the most convenient way of accessing entertainment by people who are middle-aged or old and we want to further cement on that positioning of the product and so our focus has been very, very simple in the world of entertainment, we are content IP company, do B2B do not get into B2C, on the hardware platform right now try to extend Carvaan from being a standalone product to a platform. There is no other areas we are getting ourselves into.\n\nRavi Naredi: Okay Vikram but in Caravaan we are not getting much margin and much profit. We are getting main margin from music so what is you are planning to explore the music for the company?",

    "text": "Vikram Mehra: Let me again repeat out here is remember Saregama not into the retail business for the longest time. In fact the name, Saregama itself was not a very well recognized name so when you say Carvaan will not be making money, we are not making the money because like any other new product it needed basic amount of marketing investment in the initial year and that is all that has happened. It is only the last year when we started trying to make Carvaan big right now so the initial upfront marketing expenses were there. My experience of 25 years across and I have launched multiple products across multiple categories every category seems to recourse and plays out. You in the beginning invest in building the brands recognition and in later years you start reaping the dividends for that and I do not think Carvaan story is going to be any different from that. Remember for the first two years Carvaan was completely self-sustainable making money on its own and you will see the same story coming back on Carvaan, so I am not worried on the Carvaan front. Regarding the music part is concerned we are very clear that IP creation is our main stay. We are debt free company, we are generating enough amount of cash at this juncture right now to constantly invest in films, music and TV series. Our focus is clear, we are into IP content we do not do content right now where the IP does not stay with us, we are not a service\n\nPage 9 of 30",

This is an exceptional situation that has happened. Carvaan for the longest time last year till first three quarters was 25% gross margin product, we ended up taking a hit right now on gross margin only in January, February, March because I cannot shut warehouses overnight right now and on that basis right now Carvaan at this juncture not a great profit making product for us.

Obviously you are in the investment phase so I understand it is not too profitable, but you know if you see in the current quarter when volumes of Carvaan has collapsed, the overall music profitability has actually exploded that is what I am trying to say that when Carvaan volumes fall your overall margins go up because Carvaan is not profitable but that aside over a two to three year period when do you think you will make profitability in Carvaan which is more than cost of capital I mean when do we get out of the investment phase?\n\nVikram Mehra: Two years in fact Carvaan was in profit it was only the last year that Carvaan has seen a loss, and I do not know whether I am going to use last year right now as a benchmark its primarily the last quarter that it went completely topsy-turvy for all of us from February onwards in fact. So contrary to the popular perception right now Carvaan is not a loss making proposition and we believe right now if we can successfully harness the equity of brand Carvaan and remember brand Carvaan is the only premium differentiated music brand in this country, if you check out the music streaming app you cannot differentiate one app from the other. Carvaan is the only product and this is coming on from a lot of brand consulting studies. Carvaan is regarded as only unique product in the music category especially talking to people above the age of 40 and that is the time people have money in their pocket, we want to effectively transition that equity from being a standalone product to\n\nPage 11 of 30\n\nSaregama India Limited August 03, 2020\n\na hardware based platform which can generate advertising and subscription revenue also for us without subsiding the cost of hardware.\n\nGovind Chellappa: Finally, last year you mentioned that you would be investing 200 Crores over three years for new music rights acquisition, does that still stand?",

Please go ahead.\n\nChandraprakash: Good afternoon Vikram. I had a question on the scalability of the music licensing income segment in the sense that you mentioned that now you have captured almost all platforms everywhere you find a deal so you have seen a good growth in licensing revenue over the last few years because of that it may be this year as well, incrementally how this would scale up is it more because of the organic growth of consumption of music will grow and hence that will grow or are there any steps that the company can take to increase the growth over a period of time?",

    "text": "Vikram Mehra: Sir please understand right now majority of the growth for the last four years is going at above the rate of 25% in spite of telecom revenue going away and it is actually not coming out of more partners on board, it is coming out of more users coming in so more users are getting into the digital foray and they are listening to more songs per day per user and music industry which is anything 1200 to 1400 Crores industry it has the potential to very easily start touching a 10000 Crores industry and then there are elite benefits that are coming in if the more digital series start coming up more of we watch Netflix and Hotstar the programming the runs out serials or films they end up using retro music or music per se right now and we get royalty every time our music is used anywhere. So we believe at this juncture I am maintaining my stand that we should be able in a long run basis should be able to continue growing licensing at a 25% number we do not see any issue coming in there. This is just a tip of iceberg. Global data is validating that right now universal numbers or Sony music numbers everywhere we are realizing out here is that music has seen a huge amount of upsurge everywhere. Piracy rates have just fallen down from late 80s to late 70s% right now it is still a big way to go.\n\nChandraprakash: So the deals let us say an entity like Facebook or Spotify do that give you an indication I mean the numbers?\n\nPage 12 of 30\n\nAugust 03, 2020",

If more users are consuming my content right now my revenue keeps on going up which is the biggest driver for our revenue going up year-on- year. I am showing this percentage growth in spite of caller ring back tone going away till four years back caller ringtone, that tone was about 60% of our revenue if I remember my numbers which has become zero now and still the numbers are going up. Because actual usage is going up. World over music had seen a high and then took a huge beating because of the issues of piracy now with streaming apps coming in this has given a completely new rise, streaming app now the more the number of replacements keep on coming right now for video sharing apps like Tik Tok more number of licenses are going to be issued by us.\n\nChandraprakash: During Q1 did we have any new music release in India?\n\nVikram Mehra: On the film perspective no because no film got released during this quarter, but we released a lot of non-film songs during this time and we released remix versions also for songs so that is why our numbers has not come down it is only that the filmy music was not there.\n\nChandraprakash: Thank you. Vikram can I ask one more question. You mentioned that FY2022 you may have a bunched-up movie releases, again the cost will probably come there so how many movies of that nature would be probably seen in FY2022?",

All we have done right now is to reduce our dependence on film music and keep on investing heavily on non-film also, especially regional languages so that we have newer content which is going out at all times.\n\nChandraprakash: What kind of difference would be there between regional movie music release and Hindi Bollywood movie release from a cost perspective for you?\n\nVikram Mehra: On the cost perspective Bollywood is far more expensive but also gives you revenue which are in the same multiples the risk factor and returns factor are little steeper in the case of Bollywood so what we are doing on the regional side the only area where we playing in film music is Tamil because we understand that area pretty well, all other languages we are\n\nPage 13 of 30\n\nSaregama India Limited August 03, 2020\n\nplaying in the non-film category which is relatively lower risk, low returns and untapped areas.\n\nChandraprakash: Would you have a breakup between the 200 Crores number between regional?\n\nVikram Mehra: I have internally the moment my buyer knows what the budget am I working our negotiation power goes off completely.\n\nChandraprakash: Sure. I am done. Thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Yash Modi from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.",

    "text": "Yash Modi: Congratulations for the great set of numbers I had just couple of questions one if I look at your music revenue of roughly around 69 to 70 Crores this quarter and I subtract say around 15 thousand Carvaan at 3 or 4 Crores, 65 Crores so on a 100 basis that gives me a number of 260 Crores which is like a 10% increase on 238 Crores number that you reported last year so part of it you have actually explained because the OTT number of streaming and all had happened and in April you said it is a down. Could you help us understand what was probably the exit run rate in the month of June for this IT business to understand and what portion of Facebook and Spotify contributed from June onwards or prior to that?\n\nVikram Mehra: The only part I did not answer directly is that Facebook and Spotify contributed from this quarter onwards the other thing I can certify to you right now that typically in our business taking quarter numbers and multiplying by first typically does not work there are lot depends right now that when are the deals coming up for renewals and there are some money that comes from public performances, external society, radio stations, they are booked only in the quarter which they are coming and they do not come equally in all four quarters. So the treatment becomes a bit different I maintain my number right now that the licensing revenue should be growing this year between 15% to 20%.\n\nYash Modi: Okay, thank you and secondly on this film and TV series part of it you said most of the entire quarter of Roja the Tamil serial was not on board and we are still able to do 4 to 5 Crores of revenue so we try to assume this was all due to the re-runs of TV serials that you had with you or would it include anything else as well?\n\nVikram Mehra: The revenue that you are seeing right now finally of the two movies that were released in this quarter. TV serials literally gave nothing this quarter.\n\nPage 14 of 30\n\nYash Modi: Thank you. That is it from my end.",

Rajesh just want to clarify our models does not allow us, we do not sell the license, IP is always retained by us only and these deals are typically depending on the validation anything between 3 to 10 years clearly any movie which is given for 10 years it has given us a decent enough margins. You are asking of my experience from the first movie that we people licensed out Abji to now our validation have changed completely. We were the youngest studio in town, and nobody was taking us seriously neither the buyers nor the investors everybody had the question right now why they are getting into the film business. I think we people have been able to prove right now that we can work on very, very tight budgets and schedules and produce quality products at a price that makes sense and at that pricing it becomes easier to go back and recover and make some money. The good part for the movie business functions right now, earlier we were giving all the rights to a single platform now we are carving out rights, so when we license it out to any digital platform, we give them only the digital rights sometimes only exclusive in India, international we still retain the rights, we do nonexclusive deals. We retain TV rights, we retain music right, we retain ALN rights then the rights are may be for three- or four-year period that means at renewal will again get us money. Some of the movies right now are making good amount of money from the music of those films, which literally came to us on a free of cost basis. So overall the first year of the films business was the last year for us, last year was a profit, in- profit by profit and we see this trend continuing for us. As our reputation becomes bigger, it is no longer a cost plus model, it is about what you can get for the product that we have made and in the current scenario where more and more",

I often share this in Yoodlee films which is a movie brand of ours, nobody flies business class, only the big actors get flight tickets, people travel by trains, nobody gets vanity vans, the upfront money that we pay to them is relatively on the lower side, every movie has got shot within 23 days, every movie has been within budgets, this is a very different mindset",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited August 03, 2020\n\nALT Balaji and Eros, the appetite for content is going to go up that much more that people like us who can make good movies at tight budgets will be in a very good position and the fact that two of our movies are trending in number one and number two position in the month of May and June, I think is a reflection of that.\n\nV.P. Rajesh: That is very helpful. Just a followup on that when you are getting these deals done, whether it is three years or five years, are you booking the entire revenue upfront or are you also amortizing the revenue over that period?\n\nVikram Mehra: So we actually book the entire revenue upfront and entire cost upfront.\n\nV.P. Rajesh: Okay, understood and then in terms of your cost, is has come down dramatically from Rs.125 Crores to Rs.58 Crores this quarter and obviously that is because the operations were at suboptimal level as you ramped those back up, what is the expected cost over the next three quarters?\n\nVineet Garg: This is actually because of the Carvaan numbers did not happen that way, so overall cost includes the Carvaan product cost as well, so if Carvaan sale has dropped substantially in numbers, the cost accordingly gets dropped.\n\nVikram Mehra: So let me answer it this way. On the Carvaan case the cost has come down dramatically, but still some elements of the cost are fixed in nature like warehousing, so that cost had to continue. As we go further in the quarters right now according to me if anything cost to revenue ratio should improve a bit, but on the music licensing business, we got all the revenues without investing anything in content which is a very short term way of thinking, so as we go forward right now, in the music licensing business will go up compared to the current quarter. Have I answered to your question directionally?",

    "text": "August 03, 2020\n\nthe Carvaan revenue will come proportionately cost will also come in, I think the important point what Vikram has explained that we have not purchased any content in Q1, in additionally we some going to have the cost of content also, if you compare with the last year versus this year, the fundamental difference is going to be last year we have substantial size of the marketing cost we have on the Carvaan which we did not have right now and I think we explain we are not planning to have any sizable marketing cost for Carvaan in this financial year. In this financial year, we want Carvaan to be sold based on the pull from the market rather than the push.\n\nV.P. Rajesh: So what was the Carvaan marketing cost in Q1 last year?\n\nVikram Mehra When we book at the marketing cost right now, there are movie marketing, music marketing and Carvaan marketing cost that we have booked under single entry, it was a substantial enough number that was the time we were most positioned economy had not started showing a downturn yet, but I may not be in a position to answer this specifically you are asking me. If I can give you directional answer, I will be happy to.\n\nIf you see my profit and loss account which were printed, my Q1 marketing cost was Rs.31 Crores which has dropped to Rs.6 Crores now, so that kind of drop in numbers we are looking.\n\nV.P. Rajesh: Understood, okay, thank you.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jaideep Merchant from Janak Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nJaideep Merchant: Vikram, thank you for the disclosures and the cash flow in balance sheet for the quarter, I have two questions. One, in terms of royalty, the royalty expense is about Rs.13 Crores odd, as a percentage of sales, it is much more than last year, so do we understand that the royalty on non-Carvaan constitutes majority of the royalty?",

We understand right now that taking the company to the next level and start getting into a clear leadership position right now on newer content also we will have to play that game and reputation at this juncture among some movie producers it quite well out there where most of the movie producers are more than happy to go back and partner with us.\n\nJaideep Merchant: Okay and lastly the margin on the music revenue is now reflecting on your licensing business, is there any scope for further increasing?\n\nVikram Mehra: Both ways this functions right now is, we see revenues going up, but we also for the long time right now we have not invested too much in content, so we do want to go a little more aggressive on the content investment side that is the only area in which money is going to get spend. The good part is that the manpower cost or everything else right now, all the other cost structures do not need to go up as the revenue goes up, but the content cost will go up.\n\nJaideep Merchant: Okay, thank you Vikram all the best.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Priyankar Sarkar from HSBC Global Asset Management. Please go ahead.\n\nPriyankar Sarkar: It is a more of a bookkeeping question. In terms of the inventory, which is there, which is of Rs.86 Crores all of that would be music or will there be any movie inventory also be part of that?\n\nVikram Mehra: It includes movie and TV serials and Carvaan all three.\n\nPriyankar Sarkar: Okay, but bulk up would be music, right?\n\nVikram Mehra: Bulk up will be Carvaan, not part of inventory.\n\nPriyankar Sarkar: The other thing is that cash which has increased because we have done very well in the working capital front, so that will actually reverse right more or less once things start picking up?",

Please go ahead.\n\nApurva Shah: Thanks for the opportunity. First question is on the movies library, so we have 13 movies available on Netflix and Hotstar, so how much money we have spent on making of those movies and second thing on same part is how does the economic work so as I believe like on a licensing work, so do you have typical timeframe within three years or five years whatever money we have invested that will we retain in terms of the license revenue from those platform and for rest of the year we will be getting the free money in terms of the royalty or may be whatever form it may be?\n\nVikram Mehra: First part, I will not be in a liberty to go back and tell exactly how much have we spent on the films business, I can give the answer broadly, first year there was a minor loss we had incurred because our policy is the movement of first digital deal happens. We booked the entire cost of the film in that year. So if I go back and take a movie and do a three year deal with the Netflix I will book the entire cost of the movie in that year and also the deal value with the Netflix whatever money I make from the film in the subsequent way as straightaway flows into my bottomline, are you clear about that?\n\nApurva Shah: Yes, Sir that is clear.",

In the first year, everything was done by us and then we sold as we go forward and our reputation becomes more cemented in the market, we are able to get orders from people. Given your question is what is the level or risk involve, there is still risk because we will be making a couple of movies on our own, but more and more of the work happening on films and series is on pre-order basis.\n\nApurva Shah: Okay, so question was also on risk and may be the total investment per se at company level for next three years, so Rs.200 Crores is for music and what will be other incremental investment apart from music? Is that clear Sir?\n\nVikram Mehra: On the movie part right now, I can go back and say now the movie business primarily started funding for itself.\n\nVineet Garg: If you see the movie business, the investment remain in the working capital and the small amount of debtors if we have, so investment and we are not expecting to go up substantially as we go forward it may get invested for some time and as the movie get released or licensed to person it will get converted into cash, so it is not going to be any sizable investment.\n\nVikram Mehra: It is not a working capital investment and that is the conscious call we have taken, because whenever we are doing a movie on a pre-order basis, we also take advances.",

Please go ahead.\n\nAnkit Gupta: Thanks for the opportunity Sir. Just wanted to understand the philosophy on music acquisition, the last two years we have been spending quite a bit on acquiring music rights for the growth of the company, with Carvaan series now coming down significantly and we were utilizing decent portion of Carvaan profit for acquiring new music right, so how does\n\nPage 20 of 30\n\nSaregama India Limited August 03, 2020\n\ncash alter strategy on new content acquisition and secondly post COVID and shift towards the OTT especially for new movie releases, have we seen some change in the pricing of new content music right?\n\nVikram Mehra: Yes Sir, lots of things I will start correcting sound these things now, you said we spends a lot of money on acquiring new film music in the last few years actually the number is not very high and we are very clear right now, the new music acquisition market is roughly around Rs.400 Crores odd per year and we want to have a minimum 20% play in that, in 2019-2020 and 2018-2019 we were nowhere close to that and that was an intentional cost because Saregama was getting back into film music acquisition after a long time and it was a commitment to both promoters and investor that we will take it slow for that of our policies and processing are in place and our methodology or recovering cost is fully established now that we have been able to prove that even with small investment we can go back and increase a revenue substantially, we will like to go back and increase our investment in new film music. Second part, you said right now that the Carvaan profits were allowing us to invest in music, no. Music was always making money on its own.\n\nAnkit Gupta: It was making money, but the profits generated from that were also pulling our investments in acquiring new music?",

Carvaan money was Carvaan\u2019s money, so the way we see right now going forward Carvaan has taken a temporary dip right now, because retail network is shut, we need to read it correctly here. This is not the fact even if the consumer you want to buy Carvaan tomorrow you cannot buy, because shops are not open in most parts of the country, so as the retail network starts opening up, you will see right now traction going back to Carvaan is just that to play safe this year, we have decided right now that even if the Carvaan sales number has come down, we will not take a risk by pushing doing any promotions. No marketing or promotions are going to happen this year that is what the Carvaan part is. If you see my quarter\u2019s number and where the Carvaan sale is practically negligible, the licensing business on its own is generating enough amount of cash that we can go back and invest in film and nonfilm music.\n\nAnkit Gupta: We had informed investors that you will be making good investment in acquiring new music contents so does the current situation alter plans for that?\n\nVikram Mehra: Current situation is anything right now is increasing the consumption of content. There are more people sitting at home and when you are sitting at home, you consume more music\n\nPage 21 of 30",

In the month of April, when the first time people settled at their home we saw the numbers going down substantially right now of people consuming content, by April end when people has settled in the new reality, now they may have to work from home and consumption has gone up both on the music streaming applications as well as video sharing apps. So we see this number going forward which makes us in a better position to monetize both our retro content as well as a new content we are going to go back and acquire. Have any new movie music deal has been closed right now, no. Even what Jaideep asking me about Bellbottom, Akshay movie, the deal got announced right now, the deal was agreed some five months back even before COVID-19. Right now no movie production house is the announcing any new movies, so no deals are getting struck, once normalcy comes back we will obviously take care of the fact that the valuation that we are going to be paying for a movie music will be dependent on whether the movie is getting released in theater or not. If a movie not getting release in theatre there will be clauses in agreement which will be protecting us.\n\nAnkit Gupta: Secondly on the Carvaan side, prior to Q4 we were making quarterly run rate of 200000 to 250000 units per quarter, so from the current situation in hand when do you think will get back to those numbers?",

We get enough amount of anecdotally consumer feelers that they want to know more about the product, that they want to touch and feel the product before they buy it. Please do remember Carvaan is still just about two-and-a-half year marketing story, three years to launch but we started talking about it only two-and-a-half years back, not everybody has actually touched or seen the product, they want to see the product for which retail network has to open. There is uncertainty and, in this uncertainty, I cannot give you clear projection numbers. All I can assure you is we will not do any marketing promotions till the time there is 100% clarity right now that markets are going to remain open which means this year financially it may get ruled out completely.\n\nAnkit Gupta: Carvaan has earlier you said that it has been a pretty good gifting product and Q3 and Q4 festive season has contributed in a big way to Carvaan sales, so do you think at least some of the sales we would be able to have in Q3 and Q4 of this year?\n\nVikram Mehra: We are hoping right now some amount of sale will happen on its own, if we people can manage decent percentage of sale compared to the last year and literally no investment is going in terms of building the brand any longer, I think the financial year Carvaan not going to make money but hopefully Carvaan will not even lose money.\n\nPage 22 of 30",

The music industry according to IMI which is regarded as the Indian Music Industry is only central body, where all the music companies go back and submit their revenue. If we check out the report right now and there is no Carvaan element out there, it is pure sheer music, according to them Indian Music Industry is growing at 11%, so our 22%, 23% growth right now by company I would like to believe is decent because that is double of the industry growth.\n\nRishab Garg: In this Rs.238 Crores music licensing revenue Sir, is there any cost associated with this or this is pure basically operating profit?\n\nVikram Mehra: Cost is royalty that need to be paid to the producers whose music we have taken, there is a basic sale in marketing cost which remains involved there, and if we buy any new music that cost starts getting loaded onto it.\n\nRishab Garg: But the new music you will capitalize that cost, it is not a revenue expenditure per se?\n\nVikram Mehra: Even in the new capitalization 48% of the cost or the new music will get charged up in this first year itself.\n\nRishab Garg: Okay Sir, so except for purchase of new music out of these Rs.238 Crores roughly will our operating profit be Rs.200 Crores?",

If you see the promotion that keep on happening right now every birthday and all that or the 100th anniversary of somebody there are cost associated in keeping the music alive, but yes you are right, the margins are very, very decent on the music licensing business even if we load the cost of the new contents still the margins are very healthy.\n\nRishab Garg: Any idea that you can give us like operating margins would be like\u2026\n\nVikram Mehra: Look at my numbers right now, this quarter because is very little Carvaan I do not think you need to ask me any questions, things become very obvious, just look at the segmental revenue and you will get an idea.\n\nPage 24 of 30\n\nRishab Garg:\n\nThank you very much.\n\nSaregama India Limited August 03, 2020\n\nModerator: Thank you.

Just wanted to understand I have been observing on these Amazon and Flipkart of the world the traction that Carvaan is getting, so is it fair to assume that in this lockdown period we have opened up this channel, earlier you said because of the brand building activities, it is a touch and feel product, now with more and more people knowing the brand we have seen traction building up in the e-com space, is that a fair assumption to make?",

Containment zones, many of the delivery companies they do not deliver, they have gone back and blacklisted those pincodes itself. Things were very bad in April, May, it started opening up in June, July was better than June hopefully as we move to the festival season and if God willing, we find a vaccine things should go back and improve.\n\nYash Modi:\n\nSecondly on the Facebook number, I was just looking at the likes that your page has and it has absolutely exploded in the last one month and it closed to around 16 lakh likes now on the Facebook page, so in the previous calls you told us like in the music OTT platform every time a song play, you get a variable amounts, you get a 10 paisa fee so is that something that, obviously I am not asking you details of the Facebook deal, but is that something we have to assume goes with Facebook as well or is that something different?\n\nVikram Mehra: Sorry, I did not get your question you are saying, how did the number of followers in Facebook?\n\nPage 25 of 30",

    "text": "Vikram Mehra: Every topic I get interviewed on this very often, may be lots of other people I will tell you. The model that we people follow right now is that movies do not fail, their budgets fail. So that is the key principle with which this business unit or movies have been built in Saregama. Second part, we believe that movie business is no different from any other business if the basic management principles of cost can be managed and second if individual vanity can be kept out of it completely, so as a policy the only person who gets an entry in Saregama on a movie project is the writer, nobody else can reach out to us saying they want to make a movie, we do not entertain it only if we have got a script idea is Saregama going to entertain you. No script can come to managing director position or films business head position, every script that comes in the first page is torn then it is handed over to script readers, we have 17 script readers in the company, they are not told whose script it is right now, they are giving a quantitative scale, they evaluate every script that comes to them right now on a quantitative scale and they mark it out. If the marks given by two people is higher than the benchmark we have, it goes to the script head then it goes to film head then it comes to me, everybody has the right to veto, nobody in the company has a right to green light a film. What that does is the individual choices that I like a particular kind of film goes out of the window, because every film script will start at the bottom. I may like romantic comedies a lot right now does not matter, because the script will never reach me if the people down the line have completely veto it, it is a line getting a much creditors variety of movies and taking our individual biases out. Second part, the writer\n\nnot like any other studio which buys ready films, we make our films, we have shot 13 films\n\nPage 27 of 30\n\nAugust 03, 2020",

    "text": "that means in last three years we have benchmark on every cost item, because 13 times that cost item has come back and hit us in a period of 32 months, it allows me to go back and benchmark and negotiate my price better than anybody else in the market. The third part, the only area we give complete freedom to a writer is the cast selection. I am a big believer that just because I am a managing director of the company does not make me special enough to go back and decide which hero, heroine are going to do better, we keep ourselves completely out of it, we do not decide the cast of the films, we decide the script, we decide the cost structures along with the writer, the cast is left with the writer and director. Our experience tells us the movement we remove the vanity of the management team right now, you end up getting better products. The other very interesting thing we people do right now on the budget of every films, we decide shot wave budget, so film is broken into shots, every shot the amount of hours that will be given in the cost associated with it if agreed on before the first shot is taken, the money that is disbursed on the set of films is managed by Ernst & Young who are our cost accountant on the film project. The Saregama team does not have the rights to disburse cash, the director does not have the rights to disburse cash, this way we can keep our very tight cost control and more importantly MIS reaches us at Mumbai level on a daily basis to know if there are any cost overheads happening. Other areas right now which we keep our cost under control is there is no need once again for the managing director or the films head to start travelling to film shoots I do not know what value will I add if I go to a film shoot apart from showing of my seniority. So, I keep myself complete out of it, it helps, every time senior people end up travelling, five star hotels, the flight tickets and then they will waste everybody\u2019s time, we are very, very particular",

    "text": "about this. In lot of my films in fact cast stay in the dormitory and not even at hotels to keep our cost structures down. We never shoot on sets, we do everything right now real-life locations, it gives us more authenticity and keeps our budgets down, we do not do dubbing, we do everything on life skills again keeps our budgets down gives us more authenticity. As a film is getting ready right now, other part is we do not allow any films to exceed 120 minutes, because we are getting younger crowd, we know if the films start going into two- and-a-half hours, a Bollywood hero may be able to carry it, these films cannot do it, so we keep it at 120 minutes which also helps me keep my cost structure down. When we are doing the right sale, we never go back and give up our IP. IP is always written by us, we do only licensing deals, so that in the long run as our library becomes bigger and bigger, we are talking about 13 movies hopefully we will in next year's be able to sit on 40, 50 movie library that give us in a very good position to negotiate, when the renewals of the movie will come in, we are in a far better position to negotiate by doing a big bulk deal or a slate",

Initially when we are making the movies, we were selling the movies only when they have fully ready, because studio wanted to wash the movie before they bought it.
