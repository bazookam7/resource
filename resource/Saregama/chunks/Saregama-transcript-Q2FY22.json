    "text": "Vikram Mehra: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. The last 18 months \u2013 with the COVID shadow lurking around - have had two big implications on Saregama\u2019s business. The first one was a positive one. Because of the lockdown an increasing number of middle-aged and older people were locked at home, stuck with their children and grandchildren. They used this time to get comfortable with technology. I personally know many families where there are 50+ people who have for the first time operated a bank account digitally, downloaded a Gaana or Saavn, or Spotify, or Hungama app for the first-time during Covid. They even started consuming content on Netflix or Amazon for the first time. This is the crowd that used to be scared of technology and has now started adopting it. This is great news as it is an irreversible change. Once people get used to technology, they will continue using it to consume content long after COVID recedes. Hence, we have got a very big new customer base as we slowly recover from the pandemic. India has easily leapfrogged 4-5 years in terms of digital adoption because of the forced home lockdowns.",

Film and television shoots were in for a tough time as there were multiple weeks and months, when shooting was impossible. Thankfully this was a reversible change. As the impact of the lockdown has started going away and normalcy is being restored, all our shoots are back in full swing. Similarly, the retail network too is getting back to normal. In most places, the retail networks are open. Hopefully people, from this Diwali onwards, will also start feeling comfortable walking into the retail outlets. So, while COVID has been a difficult time, with every dark cloud there is always a silver lining. In the end, as people emerge from COVID and we have done away with the negative impact, the big positive impact is going to stay in the long run. And that is a larger digital\n\nPage 2 of 16",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited October 12, 2021\n\nconsuming audience, which means a larger potential market for an IP owning company like Saregama.\n\nAfter a solid financial year 2021 performance, we have started this year with a bang as well. Our first six months have been pretty solid. Our revenue from operations during the half year touched 250 Crores, which is around 35% growth over the last year. This is somewhere understandable because last year the denominator was a COVID-based denominator. Even better news for me is that the PBT of ours on a half-year basis grew up to 82 Crores, which is up 36% from last year. If I talk about quarter 2 specifically, our revenue from operations grew by 34% while our PBT has grown by 19%. Now, this 34% growth that I am talking about, is obviously backed to a great extent by a solid performance across all the four verticals of the Company. And to some extent it also gets benefit of a lower denominator. Last year during Q2, retail networks were still shut for Carvaan. Film and TV shoots started sometime in early to mid-August. It meant that one month of Q2 was lost last year. Hence, the base was smaller and this year the performance has been even better. So we managed a 34% growth in our quarter 2.\n\nOur operating income before content charge, interest and depreciation for the quarter was 53 Crores. Now, this grew by 38% compared to last year and this gives me a lot of comfort because this shows the basic potential of the growth that we can expect in the digital economy.\n\nThe biggest profitability driver for us for the last many years has been music licensing and this quarter was no different. I have always been giving projections of over 20% growth in music licensing year-after-year and this quarter lived up to that number.",

After the big success of the song, Paani Paani - which is the Badshah song from quarter one, which is incidentally the biggest song of the calendar year 2021, by YouTube views, OTT streams, and volume of user generated content - one would have thought quarter 2 will be difficult to match. But no, we have bettered our performance in Q2. Akshay Kumar\u2019s Bell Bottom movie got released in theaters in Q2. The music of the film has done very well for us. It has done great numbers both on YouTube, as well as on OTT platforms.\n\nThis quarter also saw us launching many other original numbers. Songs like Do Ghoont and Dil Kisi Se have done very well and have been showing a great potential even after a month and a half of the launch. And you can see that impact on our financial numbers. We also released multiple songs across Bhojpuri, Tamil, Telugu and Gujarati languages in this quarter.\n\nPage 3 of 16",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited October 12, 2021\n\nIn terms of new content popularity, we are maintaining our leadership position in Gujarati category while in Bhojpuri we are number two. This quarter also marked our entry into the Haryanvi category, with our first song launch in that segment. Overall, we launched 74 songs with a big focus on the regional language side. We have been maintaining over the last 4-6 quarters that as we go ahead we will be investing heavily in new content to get into the market leadership position. Also, our strategy of new content will not be limited to Hindi and Punjabi but will also have a big play in the other regional languages of India.\n\nFor this quarter, because of the large number of songs that we released, the total content charge was INR 11.3 cr, which is actually 9 cr higher than the corresponding charge we had taken in the same quarter last year. So you are seeing an increase in our PBT in spite of a bigger content charge that we have taken in this quarter. This is a very encouraging sign for me. What it means is while we are investing, we are building on that investment and improving our profitability on the back of that investment. By the way this INR 11.3 cr, includes both the content charge and the marketing cost connected to that content.\n\nOur focus on cash management continues even after we have taken care of the dividend payout, content advances and marketing spends to push the new content. We still ended the quarter with a cash balance of INR 152 cr.",

    "text": "For us, monetization\u2019s biggest pillar has been the licensing business, which is growing steadily as the digital consumption in our country goes up. And now with the middle-aged and older people also jumping onto the digital bandwagon, we see our licensing business growing faster than that of the industry. This is because the industry was earlier driven largely by a younger audience, who are listening to new songs. Now, we not only have a huge play in new music, but also are clear leaders of retro music. With the older people jumping onto the digital bandwagon, we believe our share is going to go up substantially in the music business.\n\nThe highlight of this quarter for us was the usage of our super popular song Dum Maaro Dum by Apple in their latest iPhone 13 ad. It is a global advertisement campaign in which they ended up using this 50-year-old song. This is where we bow down to the genius of R.D. Burman. It is also a reflection of the power of the catalogue owned by Saregama. In addition, lots of other brands like Colgate, Asian Paints, Vedanta etc. ended up using our music. Once again platforms like Netflix and Zee5 ended up licensing our music for many of their original shows. That story is sustainable.\n\nPage 4 of 16",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited October 12, 2021\n\nThe increase in our licensing revenue is coming partially on the back of the industry growth. Industry is growing at 11% to 12% steadily and we are growing at more than 20%. The incremental growth for Saregama is coming bacause of the new content investments that we are making.\n\nComing to Carvaan. After literally a washout in the during Q1 because retail networks were shut during April/May and we could just manage 45k unit sales - Q2 was far better. As lockdown was lifted retail networks opened up. Simultaneously, e-commerce opened up practically in every part of the country. Net result - we ended up selling 103,000 units of Carvaan. This is inspite of no marketing spends on Carvaan yet. This is a natural customer pull through which we are selling Carvaan at this moment. While we are happy about it, we maintain our stand of cost controls on Carvaan. This is the sixth quarterly call, I think, in which I am repeating this. Till the time the COVID issue is not fully resolved, till the time we are not 100% sure that customers are going to have no hesitation walking into the retail outlets without any restriction being imposed on them (vaccination certificates etc.) we will continue with our policy of controlling our costs on Carvaan. This would reflect on both the marketing and manpower front. We are bullish on the product. We want to develop this product into a platform with recurring subscription and advertising revenue. There is work happening internally on taking the product to the next level. But no investments are going to be made in terms of marketing and manpower till the time India is back to normal. At the end of the year, I assure you guys, we will have at least a breakeven, if not a very marginal profit.",

We believe the revenue and profitability that we are talking about will continue growing for us in the days ahead.\n\nThat will be all guys. Thank you. We will be happy to take questions now.\n\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question and answer session. The first question is from the line of Aditya Nahar from Alpna Enterprises. Please go ahead.\n\nAditya Nahar: Just two broad questions. If you could just comment on the cover songs by Spotify Singles and how the economics would work? Because exactly a year back you had pretty clearly said that most likely platform companies would not be investing in their own content, and I think Spotify has come out with a Raatan Lambiyan cover. So just wanted your thoughts on that. That was my first question, and the second question is, could you give a breakup in terms of cost for your TV series which is Invisible Woman? Because you were very clear that our budgets for movies, at least, would be below a certain threshold. So if you can just talk about these two in detail? Thanks.\n\nVikram Mehra: Let me attack the second one first. We maintain our position that in the instance of TV series, we are producing on our own. We pre-license a film or a series and then produce it and that is the case with Invisible Woman as well. The series has already been licensed to a platform. So on a net-net basis right now, it will be a profitable thing for us from the word go. I hope that gives you some comfort.\n\nOn the first one on Spotify, it will be wrong on my part to comment, because it is not a song, which belongs to us, but my understanding is that the IP of that still remains there with the music label.\n\nAditya Nahar: Okay. Because I was given to understand that covers nowadays legally are a gray area.",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited October 12, 2021\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Saket Mehrotra from Tusk Investments. Please go ahead.\n\nSaket Mehrotra: Just a small question on the strategy side with respect to Carvaan. Every video that I see on your YouTube channel, it starts with a plug on Saregama Carvaan and yet I do not see there is any click to action to buy that product. So, is there any gap there or are we wanting the products to be sold through retail?\n\nVikram Mehra: So in a 5-second part, it is always very difficult to push multiple messages. Further, we can\u2019t do more than 5 seconds, according to our understanding with YouTube.\n\nComing to the other part, yes at times we do want to keep it open and not call everybody to Saregama.com because it unnecessarily upsets the other distribution channels that we have. And, all said and done, please do remember, Carvaan is still a brick and mortar sales product. You would be seeing a lot of the promotion that we carry out at times on social media - at times we have mentioned the retail network names, sometimes partner e-commerce platform names and sometimes we use Saregama.com.\n\nSaket Mehrotra: No. I ask this question because recently I saw you had this collaboration with another channel on YouTube, and there was a link there in their description. So just wanted to have that clarified because anyway we are sort of promoting that product quite hard on our own channel and just thought if there is a disconnect there.\n\nVikram Mehra: No. I can have this conversation with you off-line, but it is a thought out part, keeping in mind the restrictions that we people have on that platform. I will explain to you in more detail off- line, please.\n\nSaket Mehrotra: Okay, and, Vikram, would you like to like throw some light on the recently announced fundraise? What would that be used for? And what is the whole rationale behind it?",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited October 12, 2021\n\nAnkush Agrawal: Vikram, firstly, can you give some qualitative understanding in terms of the growth rates between different drivers of music revenues, like streaming, YouTube, social media, apps and traditional? Like what kind of growth are you seeing relative to each other between these areas?\n\nVikram Mehra: So see broadly, we don\u2019t give growth projections of specific verticals. The way we are looking at our own revenues, we are growing our overall music licensing business at over 20%. We expect growth to be in the range of 22% - 25% on a short- to medium-term basis. It is primarily driven by digital platforms, be it digital streaming or short-format video apps like Instagram Reels, Triller, Josh, Moj etc. Or it could be a license being given across to Netflix, Hotstar, Amazon and Zee5 for use as part of one of their original IPs. So digital is what is propelling the growth in a very big fashion. From the other segments, the next biggest growth driver is the TV channel space, which is growing at a slower rate than the digital part. The third is public performance, which has completely taken a beating over the last 18 months.\n\nAnkush Agrawal: Right. But on the digital side, I assume streaming would be the highest revenue contributor followed by YouTube and then social media. Could that be a right understanding?\n\nVikram Mehra: Yes. Broadly, yes.\n\nAnkush Agrawal: And secondly just a bookkeeping question. So in case of our deals, with revenue share and some minimum guarantee how do we book our revenues, like do we book only our minimum guarantee like every quarter and then at the end of the year we see, if there is an overflow and then we do the revenue share?",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited October 12, 2021\n\nVikram Mehra: What we do, if it is a minimum guarantee deal we people start invoicing it a period in advance. So there is advanced billing that happens and the money comes to us in advance. The consumption happens for the period (depending on how the period is defined) and all overflows which are connected to that period come to us at a specific frequency. This may be equal to the period or maybe longer. It could also be three or four periods combined together and the overflows are then finally disbursed to us. That is the time we recognize overflows.\n\nAnkush Agrawal: But the part of overflows would be the advertisement revenue share, per stream share and all that, right?\n\nVikram Mehra: Yes. See, the revenues calculated for a free customer is a combination of a flat rate per stream plus share of advertising revenue. For a paid customer, it is a share of the subscription revenue. So these are the ways in which revenue gets calculated and on top of this our deals come with a minimum guarantee.\n\nAnkush Agrawal: So broadly, we just book the minimum guarantee upfront like over time and then at the time of whatever the overflow time that is, in last quarter you said it is primarily in the Q3, right, for most deals? So that is when the largest part of revenue would be coming.\n\nVikram Mehra: Yes. So what we have seen recently is that some of the money came in Q1 also. It varies deal by deal . In principle what you said is correct which is what happens in case of some of the deals. But suppose after the third quarter itself we are in an overflow situation. Then for quarter four, we are booking the actuals then, because we are already crossing the levels. But, in essence every deal is different and every time the deal is going through a renewal these terms change.",

So I would just like you to reassure us of that. That is my first question.\n\nVikram Mehra: We assure you that. We people are bullish on the overall music market scenario with the digitization growing at this rapid pace and consumption of content going up so substantially. We just want to have a more aggressive play going on the music side. So we will come to you guys with more details at the appropriate time.\n\nJaideep Merchant: No. Just we wanted a reassurance that, but if it is a music because \u2018A\u2019 music, \u2018B\u2019 music, we are sitting on the side and just we do not understand your business as well as you do. We just hope that money goes into a related, I mean, just what Saregama does and I hope we are not diversifying into any other kinds of video games, entertainment or sports entertainment or any of the other entertainment fields in a larger entertainment market.\n\nVikram Mehra: We give you that comfort.\n\nJaideep Merchant: Great, sir. Second question, sir is, if you can help share with us the average selling price of Carvaan in the first half if you have it with you? And whether it was a breakeven in the first half?\n\nVikram Mehra: See, our specific prices we do not share. So I cannot get into that space with you. What I am assuring you is that, at the end of the year Carvaan will be in a breakeven situation.\n\nJaideep Merchant: Great, sir. Thank you very much, and all the best.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pritesh Chheda from Lucky Investments. Please go ahead.\n\nPritesh Chheda: Sir, I just have one question.

    "text": "Saregama India Limited October 12, 2021\n\nVikram Mehra: The music industry is growing at 11%, which means somewhere the other guys who are there in the market may be growing their revenues around that percentage. If the industry average is 11% and we are upwards of 20% at least the big boys are dealing in a fixed fee and a minimum guarantee model. So that gives you an idea of the rate at which our revenues from each of the platforms are growing.\n\nPritesh Chheda: And in our case and for the industry, or let us say, for our case is music OTT is a bigger chunk of the licensing revenues? Is there any skewness amongst all the areas of revenue which you mentioned which was music OTTs, YouTube, short video apps, advertising or exhibition business? Is it fairly spread or is there any skewness on any side of the business?\n\nVikram Mehra: In terms of the growth rate or in terms of contribution to our revenues?\n\nPritesh Chheda: In terms of contribution to revenues?\n\nVikram Mehra: Contribution-wise, music streaming is the biggest, not just for us, globally for every music label. Music streaming is the single largest contributor to our revenues. Only difference is in India, the revenues from music streaming apps are coming more out of free users. Everywhere else people are migrating from free to paid and music labels earn a share of that paid subscription revenue. So if you ask me the good story is yet to unravel in India.\n\nPritesh Chheda: Just a follow-up here. When you mention that industry is growing 11% and we are growing faster than the industry. I am just trying to correlate with the music OTT content cost. So music OTT guys, for them the content cost must be growing at 11%, right?\n\nVikram Mehra: Yes. If we say that the average of the music industry growth 11% should be the rate at which the music streaming cost structure should be looking like. You can make that kind of a jump. Albeit, directionally you may be okay. But it cannot be accurate",

Please go ahead.\n\nRahul Ramakrishnan: Vikram, first of all, just amazing work over the last five years, totally what you have done over there. So I just have one question. As we continue to gain market share, it is natural that we do face resistance from the incumbent, right? So how do you see that affecting our content cost over the next three, four years?\n\nVikram Mehra: Wish I had a crystal ball in my hand. In the music business, a larger company releasing more number of songs has an edge in having lower cost of marketing and higher realization per song. So the fight for taking premium content is limited only. There may be hundreds of smaller companies but it becomes difficult for them to pick up a big budget Bollywood film. They do not have the ability to monetize that content as effectively and comfortably. So the relative competitive intensity in our industry, while being there, is not that intense. There are only three, four of us playing out there in the Hindi space. Across these three players\n\nModerator: Vikram, sir, can you hear us?\n\nRahul Ramakrishnan: Yes. I got that. Thank you so much for your answer.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kashyap Javeri from Emkay Investment Managers. Please go ahead.\n\nKashyap Javeri: Sir, my question is on Yoodlee. The first question is that, we were expecting to reach three- digit revenues in three years. But looking at the quarterly run rate, I understand it cannot be probably a quarterly business because content creation might not be same across. But could this target be preponed for us now?\n\nVikram Mehra: I will still maintain that direction. It is not going to change.",

Sure, and second question is on, again, musical content side increasingly what we are seeing is that, a lot of singles are being produced by the artist themselves like for example, the recent Tony Kakkar song was done by a company, which is something that I have not heard of actually, to be very frank. Even we did this one music video with B Praak but if you look at the first time that they released Filhall was released by some music company which was sort of unknown type. Are you seeing increasing trends that the popular artists are going on their own creating their own content releasing on YouTube or some of the streaming apps?\n\nPage 13 of 16\n\nVikram Mehra:",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited October 12, 2021\n\nI will continue from where I left in the last answer. From the outside, it looks very easy for any individual today to go out there and launch a song. Please understand the mathematics and a typical artist on their own if they are releasing the song will be able to release 3, 4, 10, 12 songs in a year. It will take him five years to have a catalog of 60 songs. With a catalog of 60 songs if you are going to go to a leading OTT streaming platform or a short format app, it is a little difficult to get a deal. So the model that many of these individual artists follow is a bit different. They do not make too much of money right now from music. But they go out and use music as a marketing tool for themselves because then they get invited to various shows and they make money through these shows. Without taking names, chances are very high that these artistes have gone out and given the monetization rights of their own content to one of the big labels. The names that you took I can tell you off-line they are being managed by somebody else.\n\nKashyap Javeri: And so, when we look at content creation within the same business would we also be tempted to do this kind of business or we would just create on our own and do it on our own?\n\nVikram Mehra: Right now, our focus is more on IP ownership and then monetization. See, in this market, you have to be open to all possibilities. The phenomenon you are talking about is limited only to one language, which is Punjabi. This phenomenon is not happening anywhere else. Let us see in Punjabi also how long can this phenomenon continue. But for whatever reason, suppose my entire market changes, are we going to adapt? Yes, we have to adapt.\n\nKashyap Javeri: And in music, would you be able to disclose your market share in Gujarati and Bhojpuri this first half?",

The easiest way to define market share is that the content that got released in the first half, what is the amount of views that the content generated on YouTube. Out of those views how many are paid views and organic views are also questions that are going to come in. So I do not want to make an absolute number statement in front of you. Nevertheless our internal data says that in terms of new content, we are number one in Gujarati and we are number two in Bhojpuri.\n\nKashyap Javeri: Okay. Got this, sir.

    "text": "Page 15 of 16\n\nSaregama India Limited October 12, 2021\n\ninvesting heavily on new music content, both on the film side and the non-film side. We will continue differentiating ourselves vis-\u00e0-vis every other music label in terms of our focus on various regional languages of India and not limit ourselves only to Hindi.\n\nWith theaters opening up now, we expect more films to start getting released from the quarter four of the year. Some will come in Q3, majority may start coming from Q4 and the big movies that we people have acquired like Sanjay Leela Bhansali\u2019s next three projects are with us. Shankar\u2019s next movie of Ranveer Singh produced by Pen Studios sitting with us and many such large budget movies, they all will start coming out.\n\nWe continue our cautious approach on Carvaan. We will wait and watch to see which way the market moves and only when the retail networks are fully open, are we going to start once again focusing on the product.\n\nOn the film side, our stated strategy remains unchanged. On Hindi side, we will make our films and series only on a pre-licensed basis. Even on the regional side, series will be made only on a pre-licensed basis so that our exposure is not there. We will take some amount of risk only on regional languages films. We will first make them and then license out. But even there our endeavor will be to ensure 70% cost of the film should get presold and pre-recovered through TV, cable and satellite deals. So overall, we expect this year to be pretty decent, both from the top line and the bottom line perspective.\n\nThank you, ladies and gentlemen. I hope to talk to each of you guys again after the end of the quarter three. Thank you.\n\nModerator:\n\nThank you very much. On behalf of ICICI Securities, that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you.\n\nPage 16 of 16",
