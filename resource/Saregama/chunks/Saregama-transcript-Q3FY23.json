    "text": "Vikram Mehra:\n\nHi. Good evening, everyone. Quarter 3 saw operating revenues of INR 185 crores and PAT of INR 2 crores. That is a year-on-year growth of 23% in our revenue and 20% in PAT. So it's been a pretty good quarter. We would once again reiterate and request you to please look at our business always on an annual basis and never evaluate it on a quarterly basis. People often wonder why there should be a seasonality in music - actually, there is. The part of the music business, which is dependent on advertising revenue like YouTube - that fluctuates. Carvaan sales, which are dependent on the festival season too fluctuate over the year.\n\nAlso, our policy of recognizing overflows from agreements which have a minimum guaranteed base is such that the overflows are recognized only in the quarter when the money is received by us. So, there is fluctuation that keeps on happening from quarter-to-quarter. Hence, please look at the number always on an annual basis and not on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\n\nIf I look at our numbers on a 9-month basis and both our revenue and PAT has grown by 36% and34% respectively. This is in continuation to the last year's growth numbers of 31% in operating revenues and 35% in PAT. There's a reason I'm stating and quoting the last year numbers. This is to give you the confidence that the growth that you are seeing is not something which has been happening for only a couple of quarters.",

    "text": "We now have been showing growth on revenue and bottom line for over 16 quarters now on a consistent fashion quarter after quarter. Whether it was during the time of COVID, post COVID, our growth story is continuing. And remember, we have just touched the tip of the iceberg. 750 million people have a smartphone, while only 200 million people are actually using any of the streaming services yet. There are a lot of new customers who will be coming in and consumption per customer is also expected to go up. On an average, people listen to 67 songs in a month. We believe in all developed countries; this number is closer to 120 songs per month. You will see that kind of growth happening in India, too., This means the Saregama growth story in the medium to long term is going to remain stable. Also, ours is a diversified business model, which ensures that there's not too much dependence on any one source of revenue, be it",

We are quite diversified in that sense and will ensure that we'll be able to maintain our profitability as well.\n\nThe music business, which is a combination of both licensing and Carvaan saw its highest quarterly revenue at INR 154 crores. On a 9-month basis, Music segment grew by 25% year-on- year to achieve a INR 433 crores revenue. As mentioned, both licensing and Carvaan contributed to this growth.\n\nLet me first start with licensing, which continues its growth number of over 20% year-on-year. This will be the fourth or the fifth year that we have been growing at this rate. We released multiple film songs across Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali, Punjabi and Hindi Languages. We also released Sanjay Leela Bhansali's first non-film music album Sukoon. Punjabi saw 2 successful non-film songs from Satinder Sartaaj. Bhojpuri language saw 4 massive hits on the non-film side from its number one artist Khesari Lal Yadav. Collectively, they crossed 15 crores view on Saregama's official Bhojpuri YouTube channel in one quarter.\n\nIf we see over the last 9 months, we have taken a new content charge, which is inclusive of marketing of INR 50 crores. Just for reference, the same number was INR 30 crores a year back. The strategy of investing in new content is clearly paying off. It's not only allowing us to grow our new content market share but is also giving us huge impetus to our catalog.",

    "text": "Last financial year, we raised INR 750 crores with an explicit mandate to invest this money in new music content, and we are on track. I want to again assure you this money that was raised will be used only and only for music. All the other investments that we are doing \u2013 are from our internal accruals. Often asked question is how do we go about picking up new content? I think our biggest edge is the investment that we have done on data mining and building predictive models to decide what content to invest in.\n\nAnd also, our longer-term deals, which have happened on the marketing side, is giving enough confidence to our partners that we can market content like nobody else -which is pushing them to work more and more with us. Movie music acquisition deals have been locked across Hindi, Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam languages. You will see some of the movies have been delayed. You will see a lot of them coming hopefully between March to June timeframe this year.\n\nThis includes the highly anticipated next directorial movie of Karan Johar called Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani. There is another Dharma Production called Rola, starring Vicky Kaushal and Ammy Virk. There's one more Vicky Kaushal and Sara Ali movie called Zara Hatke Zara Bachke. There is a Vijay Deverakonda and Samantha film called Kushi. There are 2 Suriya films in Tamil. There's also a Mammootty and a Prithviraj Sukumaran film in Malayalam. These are some of the big titles that I can think of. Their music has already been acquired by Saregama.\n\nWe will continue investing across all Indian languages, both on the film and non-film side. We have already achieved leadership position across a few of the languages, and we are at number two in some of the other languages. We expect to be at number one position in the next 12-18 months across all major languages in India.",

    "text": "Page 3 of 19\n\nsare ga mafl\n\nSaregama India Limited January 24, 2023\n\nCarvaan numbers maintained the growth trajectory. They touched 168K compared to 141K last year. Remember, this year, the festival sale was divided between quarter 2 and quarter 3 because of the timing of Diwali. This is unlike last year where the entire festival sales boost came in quarter 3. That's why you see the growth numbers between quarter 2 and quarter 3 are different this year compared to last year. This is because a lot of festival sale had been booked in quarter 2 already. If I combine both the quarters, that is quarter 2 and quarter 3, we have sold 324,000 units of Carvaan. And all these numbers are coming only out of customer pull. There is no advertising backing Carvaan now for over three years.\n\nThe latest variant of Carvaan, Carvaan Mobile has given us a lower price point, which is helping us penetrate smaller markets. The con of this is that the average realization of our sold Carvaan unit has come down Although, the upside of penetrating smaller markets far outweighs the cons. This means that though the unit sales have gone up substantially compared to last year, the revenue numbers would not have grown., But it is still a healthy growth compared to last year. There is no marketing push, which is planned for Carvaan even in Q4.\n\nFilm, Series and Events vertical touched around INR 100 crores in the first 9 months. It is a matter of great pride for us. It literally means that the revenue has doubled compared to the INR 50 crores revenue that we wrote in the first 9 months of the last financial year. And most of it is coming on the back of the new vertical that we have created called Live Events. Overall, Film, Series and Events now constitute 15% of the company revenues.",

    "text": "One of the big advantages of this vertical is giving us a huge edge in music acquisition.This is because of the fact that we can now give breaks to people on live events also means that artists are more forthcoming and more open to selling their stand-alone songs also to us.They see a much deeper relationship possible with Saregama compared to any of our competitors.\n\nBut again, remember that Live Events business is a relatively low-margin business. So as the mix keeps changing, it will have its impact on the PBT percentage, though the music PBT percentage remains unaffected.\n\nYoodlee saw action this quarter, 2 Malayalam and one Punjabi movie got released during this quarter. Prithviraj Sukumaran's movie Kaapa got released in Malayalam. It opened to great reviews and a good theatrical collection. The movie also got released on Netflix recently and opened at number one trending position and is currently trending in number two across India on Netflix.\n\nOur TV serials that we make and are put up on Sun TV, they continue to do very well in terms of TRPs. We launched a new Tamil serial called Iniya, replacing our existing serial called Roja after 1,300 episodes. Remember, we had launched another serial called Illakkiya in quarter 2, which had replaced Chandrslekha, a serial thathad also completed 2,000 episodes.\n\nAll the three serials that we have on Sun TV are actually slot leaders, giving us a strong position.",

We also premiered our own IP show Disco Dancer in London. This is our first attempt to go out there and create movie-based musicals, which can attract many people in their 40s and 50s. basically people who have a greater spending power. We will use the equity of those movies and get the customers in and enjoy the songs that are part of these musicals. We also intend to record these songs and then monetize the videos of these songs on various platforms like YouTube and Facebook.\n\nThe next season of Disco Dancer will be happening in the financial year '24. So overall, we are comfortable right now and happy with the way this quarter has progressed. Our mainstream music has done well, and it continues to grow at over 20%. The Films, Television Serials, Event Business, will always be seasonal in nature, depends on which event is coming in which quarter. But on an overall basis at INR 100 crores, I think it's becoming a substantial chunk of our overall revenues. That will be all. Thank you. We'll be happy to take questions now.\n\nModerator: We have a first question from the line of Ankush Agrawal with Surge Capital.\n\nAnkush Agrawal: Firstly, just a clarification. So, our music licensing business has grown at a usual 20% plus rate for this quarter as well, right?\n\nVikram Mehra: Yes, it's over 20%. We will be sharingthe growth numbers, both on Music and Carvaan separately at the end of the financial year. Yes, I'm giving the comfort right now, it is upwards of 20%.\n\nAnkush Agrawal: So, Vikram what explains our lower PBT growth of just 11%? Like, have we made some kind of losses in the Carvaan business or what explains that?\n\nVikram Mehra: Mix is changing. Remember, as we people are going further and further, the Live Events, Films and Series is a much lower margin business.",

But if the payback periods become shorter, there may be an increase in the content cost.\n\nIf we are still able to maintain a discipline of not picking up content with a payback period of greater than 5 years, we are still in the same space. My revenue goes up, maybe my cost also goes up. I still maintain a payback period of 5 years. So that's our guiding principle. We do a combination of film music versus non-film music, Hindi music versus Bhojpuri or Gujarati or Bengali or Telugu or Tamil music. And we do so across languages, because it puts me in a position to balance my investments in each of these languages. This ensures that on an overall basis, I'm still within 5-year payback period.\n\nModerator: We have the next question from the line of Ravi Naredi with Naredi Investment Private Limited.\n\nRavi Naredi: I was asking that the company that we are trying to separate, we had done an EGM, what is the benefit to shareholders of Saregama? And what is the business that company is doing?\n\nPankaj Chaturvedi: The shareholders of the company have approved the demerger. The result of the shareholders meeting has also been filed in our petition with NCLT in the month of January. We are monitoring this, and the things are on track. The final order should come to us before 31st March.\n\nVikram Mehra: On the benefit side, it's just about getting our company more sharply focused. Around 5, 6 years ago, we made the first round of changes in Saregama where we got out of all non-core businesses. There were some other investments that were lying out there within Saregama, and some parts of the business, which were not core to what Saregama does. So, to bring more focus within Saregama, we decided to hive it off as a separate business so that both businesses can do justice to their core.",

Sir, second, when we met our QIP, when our fund will be utilized in the company, whatever purpose we raised QIP?\n\nVikram Mehra: We are constantly looking at opportunities, whereby we can pick up catalogs. But at a price point that is value accretive to all our investors. There's no point picking up large catalogs, if they come, -- at a price point, which makes no financial sense for us. The good part is we have the money to close the deal at any time. But we are following a very prudent policy so that we don't end up overpaying just because money is sitting there with us.\n\nRavi Naredi: Right. That is intelligent thing.\n\nVikram Mehra: Internally, I can give you this comfort that we are maintaining a very strong audit on the financial investments because this money has to be utilized only and only for music and nothing else. So this money is typically invested in relatively very low risk debt. That way the money is protected and the moment we get opportunities of investing in other businesses, which somewhere are going to help our music business either directly or indirectly, we will move in immediately. We are any time are in dialogue with at least 4 to 5 companies, but the deals must happen at the right valuation.\n\nPage 7 of 19\n\nsare gd magl\n\nRavi Naredi:\n\nSaregama India Limited January 24, 2023\n\nAnd Vikram, your new initiatives like Diljit Dosanjh and Disco Dancer, please tell few words for same how they are running revenue-wise in our company in third quarter?",

    "text": "Vikram Mehra:\n\nSir, you can see the third quarter numbers, where the Live Event is reported along with Films and Televisions. We did around INR 27 crores. I think for Live Events Q1 and Q2 were bigger because we held concerts in US and Canada in those quarters, quarter 3 were only India as far as Diljit Dosanjh is concerned. Live Events business has got 2 reasons why we're doing it.\n\nOne, yes, there is margin, but the margins are very small here. What it does is that when an artist comes to know that not only can he sing songs for Saregama, but he can also do Live Concerts with Saregama, then the artist wants to work with the company that much more than he wants to work with the competition.\n\nThe competition may be offering only songs and nothing else. That's our main edge. So multiple artists are now reaching out to us and saying, listen, we want to give you our songs, maybe at a discount, but can you also do something on the live business with us. So, it's just building synergies. For us, it's just a natural extension of our music business. We are very clear on the Live Event side that we will do only and only music related events. We are not going to start holding exhibitions and conferences, that's not the business that we are in. So, if there is a live event happening, it will be mostly IP-related and always connected to music.\n\nRavi Naredi: And sir, last, my question is revenue growth is 25% in 9 months, do you think such growth possible in future and for how much we get?",

    "text": "Vikram Mehra: I'm not going to run away from the fact that there will be short-term pressure coming here and there in the industry as OTT services move from advertising to subscription. But we are reasonably confident that the quality of our catalog and our new music acquisition will ensure that we will be writing this 22% to 25% growth even in the short run and in the medium to the long run. As far as since Events and Live business is concerned, we have been showing that our growth is far higher. In 9 months, we have literally grown 100% there. So, I don't see too much of a trouble right now for that business also to grow at 25%.\n\nModerator: We have next question from Bhupendra Tiwary: with ICICI Securities.\n\nBhupendra Tiwary: My first question was on the new content. So, you talked about Ranveer Singh movie, I think 2 Vicky Kaushal movie and then Vijay Deverakonda movie and then couple of regional content apart from, I think, the tie-up we have with Arijit and Sanjay Leela Bhansali, one we released on this time around. So now one, I just wanted to understand how the pipeline is of content? I think I believe that the movie pipeline itself was smaller last year in terms of the Hindi movie vis-a-vis the pre-COVID times.\n\nSo how is the overall pipeline, I mean, new content pipeline that we see apart from the big names, so I understand that. And has it changed the economics kind of I think in terms of the competitiveness, has it come down in terms of the content acquisition cost? What are you observing there? That was my first question, after which I'll ask the couple.\n\nPage 8 of 19\n\nsare gd magl",

    "text": "Vikram Mehra:\n\nSaregama India Limited January 24, 2023\n\nMovie production is back in business. The problems of COVID are long forgotten. Also, increasingly you're seeing movies getting released in theaters rather than going to a digital platform directly. This is good news because any movie that goes to theaters, typically the music of that movie does far better than a movie which is going to the digital platform directly. So, you will have visibility on all the 4 big languages, Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, and Malayalam.\n\nAnd there are multiple releases lined up both with the bigger stars and the smaller stars, budget movies, smaller budget films. When we acquire music in any particular language, we follow a portfolio approach, whereby there are some big more expensive but high-profile films that you end up taking and then multiple smaller to middle budget films that we end up taking. The risk factors are greater in smaller films. But if they fire, they fire big time.\n\nLarger budget films typically do well because you pay that much amount of money only and only because there's a big star cast, composer and singers connected to it. So that's how typically this entire planning goes about on the film music side. Hindi film acquisition typically happens anything around 8 to 12, 15 months in advance of the release of the film. That's a stage at which composes are being finalized and singers are being finalized and situations are being finalized and that is the time we come in often, if it's a large budget film. If it's a smaller budget film, then we come in only when the songs are fully ready. On the Tamil and the Telugu side, we end up acquiring music typically 6 to 9 months in advance for very big guys and maybe a month earlier for smaller budgets films. Have I answered your question?",

We had a couple of web series lined up for release -- I mean, under the process. So how are they are lining up? And do we expect a couple of them releasing by FY '24, I mean, what is the timeline?\n\nVikram Mehra: Always remember, there always will be a delta between us closing the deal with the platform and handing over the series to them and getting our money and recognizing the revenues, while the platform may take its own time to finally schedule the release of the series, depending on whatever suits them. Our series model is safer, because we typically start work on the series only once we have a mandate from a platform. We are trying to pitch series both on the large scale, as well as the small to medium scale. At the same time, there's a lot of emphasis going on films in regional languages, which is Malayalam, Punjabi, and Marathi, which can first hit the theater and then eventually go to TV and digital platforms.\n\nBhupendra Tiwary: Sure. So, we had 2 or 3 series, if I'm not wrong, which we were working on, which we had announced, 2 I could remember, web series, I think. Has it been -- I mean, has the shooting and all those things completed or it's under...\n\nVikram Mehra: So majority of the part is completed here. Unfortunately, our contracts with our platform forbid us to any mention of anything until the time they are not ready to talk about it. So, the film business in that sense is simpler because you decide you want to do a film, within 6 to 9 months a film shoot is completed. Series business is a longer wait time because scripting itself takes",

    "text": "Vikram Mehra:\n\nAs a policy we don't talk about individual partner deals. But I had a similar question being asked to me at the end of quarter 1 on our deal with Meta. And that time also said this, and I'm repeating the same thing here. Often, we will have deals going or deals being put off as part of the negotiation process with various partners of ours. Our role as a management team is to ensure that while we are negotiating with the partner, and having -- at times having to take a tough stance of pulling off our content from those platforms, the overall revenues cannot fall. If we are pulling off content from one platform, we need to ensure that - the customer of that platform moves to some other platform and listens to my song.\n\nSo if you are fond of listening to our latest Arijit song or Badshah Ka Pani Pani, and if it's not there on platform A, you will go to platform B and listen to it, and we get compensated that way. So in fact, in spite of the fact that we may not be there on some of the platforms in this quarter, my music revenue has still grown by over 20%.\n\nModerator: We have next question from the line of Dheeresh Pathak with WhiteOak Capital.\n\nDheeresh Pathak: A few questions. First is, what percentage of our YouTube views would have an ad load?\n\nVikram Mehra: See, I cannot comment as specific and particular as that. The YouTube revenue depends on 3 factors. Factor number one, how many views have our videos been able to generate, the number of videos on which an ad is put and the rate at which ads are coming in. So, the part 2 and part 3 are more in the hands of YouTube than in our hands, they keep on fluctuating. But overall, we are seeing a healthy growth coming out of YouTube.",

When we people report the YouTube number data, its reporting data both for YouTube as well as YouTube Shorts, which is a YouTube property, and it's a collective part of that.

There are specific deals where there's a huge increase that people saw, and hence you saw this number.</td></tr><tr><td/><td>Remember whether it's the audio or video streaming platforms some of the bigger names are international guys</td></tr><tr><td>Dheeresh Pathak:</td><td>Yes. So that's what I'm saying. So hypothetically, let's say if it is Y ouTube, you get Y ouTube consumption is happening by Y ouTube users in India, but you struck a deal with them at an international level, so you'l classify that as international revenue stream, right?</td></tr></table>",

Because when you acquire content on the balance sheet, at least my understanding is it is showing up in 3-line items, one is an intangible, second is in inventory and third is in current assets. So, this content charge that you mentioning is summation of all those new costs which are capitalized and then expensed through the P&L in operating costs, as well as amortization, as well as royalty, right? Pankaj Chaturvedi: That's correct. So apart from the 3 items on the balance sheet, you also have a marketing cost, which is entirely charged to P&L. That is also part of the content charge as we have defined in our presentation as well.

Our experience shows right now that the revenues are still holding steady.\n\nNitin Sharma: Understood. And 2 for bookkeeping question. So, what led to fall in the other expenses in this quarter?\n\nPankaj Chaturvedi: So, it's some of the expenses we had to regroup, reclassify with the revenue. So that's basically a P&L neutral item as it's not impacting P&L.\n\nNitin Sharma: Okay. So, is it from item already classified as bad debt and then it got recovered, something like that?\n\nPankaj Chaturvedi: We can\u2019t go into specific line item, some of the expenses we had to regroup, reclassify with the revenue which had no impact on the bottom-line.\n\nNitin Sharma: Understood. And the last question, I see a clothing segment on your website. Can you please talk about this?\n\nNitin Sharma: There's a clothing segment on your website, I think some T-shirts or catalogs being sold. Can you just talk about it? Is this some promotional activity or a new segment?\n\nVikram Mehra: You're talking about clothing segment. There are small experiments that are being done right now all times about how to further monetize our IP. Many such experiments always run at a very, very small scale. We typically don't talk about it till the time they don't reach at least some substantial chunk. So, this is one of the multiple experiments being carried out on the merchandising side. When the segment becomes substantial either in terms of cost, or hopefully in terms of revenue, then I'll talk about it, it's just too early.\n\nModerator: We have the next question from the line of Savi with 2Point2 Capital.",

    "text": "Savi: I just had a question on the service business. If I look at the segmental results for 9 months, that has fallen as compared to last year, fallen by quite a bit, whereas the capital employed has increased substantially. So, while the profitability has decreased by more than 50%, the capital employed has almost doubled. So, both the profitability and the return on capital has declined for this segment. Is this -- I mean, how should I read this?\n\nVikram Mehra: So, for the first part, you should read it this way that fortunately or unfortunately we are combining the Live Events business also. So whatever impact you're seeing is on the Live Event. Live Event is not even a 1-year-old business. It has got its own one-off costs that has been put out here. And hence, you are seeing some profitability being on the lower side on a 9-month basis, still it is healthy enough business. As far you are talking about the money, which is locked here, there are multiple large projects that have been kick started as we people try to scale up the entire film business, so that's what's there. You will see many of the films coming out over quarter 4 of current financial year and quarter 1 and quarter 2 of next year.\n\nPage 13 of 19\n\nsare gd magl",

So there is -- hopefully next year or maybe a year after that we will start splitting maybe the Event business separately, then you can actually see the actual money locked out there on the film side as well as the return that is giving. We have committed to a 15% to 20% margin. That's the only thing I've stated until now on the Films and Series business, and we are holding ourselves to that commitment.\n\nSavi: Okay. And on the content cost side, where there's obviously a Q-o-Q decline. There's a Y-o-Y increase, but I mean the amount of investments that we are making does not seem to be significant in context of the amount of cash we have. So is it that the competition has increased significantly, and we don't want to partake in that and that's why we are staying away from acquiring...\n\nVikram Mehra: I'll tell you what exactly has happened here. There were 4 big films that were supposed to be released in quarter 3. When we people go out there and plan our calendar of releases, we keep in mind that in any month, there's no point having too many big projects being released in the same language. Unfortunately, on the Hindi side, lot of films have got pushed. Seeing the debacle of some of the larger budget films on the Hindi side, many producers went back to the drawing board to further fine tune their films, which has pushed the release dates of some of our films.",

Vikram Mehra Y ou'll be happy to know that majority of our revenue is protected through fixed fee or minimum guarantees. So, any quarterly seasonality or even an annual seasonality can be borne by us very easily. Further, we get a share of advertising revenue and subscription revenue. In lot of cases, there's a licensing fee that we end up getting. So, we are reasonably protected. Nobody is completely protected if the market really starts tanking. But we have been quite prudent over the last 2 years when our financial numbers were doing well, and our profitability has been going up. If you see the manpower expenses as a percentage of revenue it has fallen down. So, we did not go overboard increasing our cost structure just because there was a great time that had come in between, and we maintain that kind of prudence even today. Anika Mittal: That's right.

And numbers are also showing that. What is the reason for muted growth Q-o-Q? Because it was festive season and all this thing so.\n\nVikram Mehra: Yes, there is the festival season. Quarter 3 for Carvaan and YouTube typically ends up doing well. Then, there is also the nature of the contracts that we have. Usually, all the overflows come out there in quarter 2 or quarter 3 of the financial year, so it happens. So, there is that kind of a movement that also happens. I think the best way for you to look at us is on a trailing 12-month basis. That will give you far more comfort.\n\nAnika Mittal: Okay. That's the thing. And where do you see our top line by the end of FY '23? And how big do you expect Q4, considering the significant business you did in Q4 FY '22?\n\nVikram Mehra: So, sir, as I said right now, traditionally, Q3 is our best quarter. Our attempt, obviously, will be to maximize the revenues in quarter 4. But the variations are not going to be wild variations Yet traditionally, Q3 is the biggest quarter for us. Let's see which way the quarter goes. But on a long-term basis, I'm holding on to our guidance of music licensing growing between 22% to 25% and Films, Events and Series business on an annual basis, growing at 25%. I think that should give you more comfort than just a quarter part because quarters move here and there.\n\nModerator: We have next question from the line of Aditya Nahar with Alpna Enterprises. We move on to the next question. Our next question is from the line of Shubham Ajmera, with SOIC Ventures LLP.",

There is a Vicky Kaushal and Sara Ali Khan movie Zara Hatke Zara Bachke. Again, the dates have been announced for Feb/March as of now. We are still awaiting clarity on if they want to change the date. It's a very common practice in our industry for producers to change dates.\n\nThen there is a Vicky Kaushal, Ammy Virk film called Rola lined up. Then there is an Ajay Devgn film coming called Maidaan. Also, there is a Ronnie Screwwala movie called Pippa. This in fact was planned for '22, then became early '23, now we're hearing it may go to mid '23. Then there is big Telugu film Kushi starring Vijay Deverakonda and Samantha Ruth Specifically naming this because both these artists are very well known in the Hindi space too. We have Prithviraj Sukumaran's films in Malayalam coming in the Q1 and 2 Surya films which will be coming hopefully in Q3 of the next financial year.\n\nWe also have a Mammootty and an Ajith film, which are locked. Then on the Tamil side, we have a Sivakarthikeyan film and a Dhanushs film, which is locked. So, there's a range of stuff that we people are working in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam, which you will keep on seeing over the next few weeks, months, hopefully in the calendar year '23. We have also learned our lessons. So, we are going to be prepared that if there are a large number of movies getting pushed, then there will be a lot more non-film songs that will keep coming out.\n\nShubham Ajmera Understood. And on the Mango Music, like the acquisition which we have done last year of Mango Music, so just wanted to check like, is it started resulting in the financial terms as well?",

We have jumped from literally not being a player in Telugu to a clear number two position in Telugu, which is a combination of some great new music and the Mango catalogue acquisition.\n\nShubham Ajmera Understood. And my last question is on the Carvaan business. So, like can you share the product mix in the Carvaan. How much percentage is from the newer mobile versions, which we have launched? And how much is from the older variant per se.\n\nVikram Mehra: Unfortunately, I'll not be able to share that information. But I've been stating for the last 2 quarters that Carvaan Mobile is playing a substantial enough role. The old Carvaan is a product -- is a 5-year-old product now and has got no marketing support over 3 years now. So it's been a newer products and variants of Carvaan like Carvaan Mini, Carvaan mobile obviously, which is helping us that much more.to sell these many number of units.\n\nModerator: Ladies and gentlemen that was the last question. And now I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Vikram Mehra: for closing comments. Over to you, sir.\n\nVikram Mehra: I'll just repeat whatever I said earlier. We maintain our bullish stance on music licensing. We expect a 22% to 25% annual growth over the next 3 to 5 years. The next 12-18 months , where we will see the transition of the OTT or the music streaming industry from an ad-based model to a subscription-based model, will have its short-term pressures and things will go topsy turvy.",

We will continue with our aggressive investments, both on film and the non-film music side across all the major leading languages of the country. We are on a constant lookout and conversations with multiple companies which are either music catalogs or companies which are connected to the world of music -may not be directly holding catalog - but may help us a lot in promoting new music.\n\nWe're talking to a multiple such entities and evaluating if any acquisition is possible at a valuation that makes financial sense. We continue with a cautious approach on Carvaan, and the focus will be to continue to manage our margins and not the top line. Carvaan will continue at least to do breakeven. The film, TV series and the events vertical, I expect it to grow at 20%, 25% growth year-on-year, and we hope to make anything around 15% margin on this business.",

It will take a couple of years right now before stability that comes in. Itwill be a very low-margin business at least in the first couple of years. We will continue with this because strategically, it helps us with our music acquisition. Overall, I assure all of you once again that we are well protected from the vagaries of advertising revenues going up and down on a quarterly basis. But hopefully, we are well prepped and don't have high cost structures for us to suffer in case things go dramatically wrong. I'm hopeful right now that we will maintain our profitability and the growth projections, we have given you on a short to medium term basis. That would be all.
