    "text": "Vikram Mehra:\n\nHi, good evening everyone. What an eventful year for us, with the impact of the digital revolution along with our content play.\n\nSo, FY23 saw operating revenues of Rs. 751 crore and a PAT of Rs. 189 crore. This basically means that on year-on-year basis our revenue has grown by 29%, while PAT has grown by 24%. In fact, what I am prouder of is that it is not a one-off journey. If you actually see our seven-year journey which we have also shared in our Corporate Presentation, our revenue has been growing at 23% CAGR for the last seven years now, while our profits have been growing at 59% CAGR.\n\nI have always requested all of you people and I continue requesting, to please look at our numbers always on an annual basis and not on a quarterly basis. Our business unfortunately cannot be analyzed on a quarterly basis. One, because of the seasonality that plays a very important role here as advertising revenues completely fluctuate depending on the seasonality. And Second, the accounting treatment of our overflows which we book whenever the overflows come in and the nature of advertising and overflows is such, that for us Quarter 3 is the biggest quarter then it is Quarter 2, then Quarter 4 and then Quarter 1. So, whenever you are analyzing us, either do on a financial year basis or a rolling 12-month basis.\n\nOur growth has been great, but I am very confident that we have still just touched the tip of the iceberg. The digital consumption in our country is not going to stop. It\u2019s going up both in terms of more people joining the bandwagon of buying a smartphone and also people who have a smartphone consuming that much more content on it. Content can be anything, it can be audio,\n\nPage 2 of 20",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited May 19, 2023\n\nit can be video, it can even be gaming. Overall, as people get hooked onto this digital economy, they will end up consuming content connected to a company like Saregama.\n\nWe are also seeing more and more people getting comfortable with the payment economy that fits behind digital. Five years ago, nobody used to go out there and pay. Today\u2019s younger generation is getting more and more comfortable to pay for gaming. The good part is if you pay for gaming you are going to be equally comfortable paying for other audio or video content, which from our perspective looks like a great future where both not just advertising based revenue, but subscription-based revenue may also kick in, improving the profitability of an IP owning company like Saregama. Remember with technology platforms\u2019 fortunes change. For a pure-play content IP company like ours, \u2018Lag Jaa Gale\u2019 song was a superhit 60 years ago also, 30 years ago also and today also is one of the top songs of the country. And that\u2019s the beauty of an audio or video IP owning company.\n\nLet me brief you on the status of our demerger scheme which was approved by the shareholders. The current status is that our application for demerger was heard by NCLT on 28th of April. The pronouncement of the order is still pending. Awaiting the final order sanctioning the scheme, our financial results have been prepared without giving the effect of demerger. Once we get the order the scheme will be effective and necessary revisions are going to be made in the financials.",

    "text": "Let me start with the music piece. I think the biggest industry change that I have been talking for couple of years now has started rolling up which is the movement of streaming platforms from being a free platform to a subscription-based platform. We saw three platforms during this year announcing formally that they want to move completely behind a paid wall. which means out of the nine platforms six platforms are going to be now behind the paid wall.\n\nI have repeatedly explained that a song which is heard by a paid subscriber is commercially that much better for us than a song which is heard by a free customer. Globally if we look at it, we are seeing around 589 million people paying for music subscription and listening to music that way. In fact, 67% of music industry revenue actually came from streaming. Just imagine if we are making this much amount of money when paid subscription is yet to take off what will happen once it takes off. And the signs are now there.\n\nThere are only three platforms that are left who haven\u2019t turned paid. I will again warn you that in the short run it will create pressure on all of us. If people go behind a paid wall, you will see the monthly active user base falling in the short run. But on a short to medium term basis, I see far more money being made by all stakeholders including the IP owners like Saregama. And since we are sitting on the bulk of the music IP I think we will have one of the biggest advantages that you want to see of subscription-based economy taking off.\n\nThe other thing that works well to our advantage is that we have a very strong catalogue from the Southern part of the country- Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada. We are seeing traditionally whenever paid subscription has taken off its led more by the South Indian states\n\nPage 3 of 20",

Since we have a larger share of the South Indian languages\u2019 content, we believe we will have a big advantage as India starts moving towards subscription.\n\nOur licensing revenue this year grew by more than 20% for the fifth year in a row and a big driver for this growth has been new content acquisition. The thing which almost sounds unbelievable to most people and at times even to us is that if I look at FY '23, 48% of our revenue actually came from music which has been released post-2000. People often call Saregama a catalogue company. I can hardly call it a catalogue company with close to 50% of our revenues flowing from 21st century music.\n\nWhat makes us even more proud is not just the fact that we are picking up a lot of music in Telugu, Malayalam, Hindi, Bhojpuri, Gujarati, but the fact that we are picking up winners. It\u2019s not about just picking up songs that are coming out - that\u2019s an easy thing anybody can do it. It\u2019s about being very stringent about how you go about picking up the music. The investment that we people have made in data analytics, predictive modeling and the entire decentralized decision-taking process where one person sitting in Bombay at the senior level is not taking the decisions. It is the people who are locally based and have strong KRAs that can be controlled and evaluated, who are taking the help of the data models which have been created and take decisions This results in allowing us to pick winners and perform far better than any of our competitors.",

We have given data point after data point in each of the languages showing how our songs are scoring extremely well in all the major charts that are announced by all the streaming platforms and YouTube. So, we have given examples of Spotify charts, we have given examples of YouTube numbers, have a look and you will realize that our content selection is really clicking.\n\nIn fact, if I look at YouTube alone, 11 of our songs released in 2022 have already crossed 100 million views on our own channel. I am not even talking of our older releases and Kishore Da and Rafi Sahab music is not included here. This is the latest music we are talking about. There is Hindi, Telugu, Punjabi, and Bhojpuri sitting in there.\n\nIf you look at the subscriber base of all the channels that Saregama has and similarly for all our competition, we did not have the largest subscriber base on YouTube because we did not own too much video content. In fact, all the content we own pre-2000 is primarily only audio. So, we did not have too much of a play on the video side. Now that we are investing in the newer content which comes along with the video, the subscriber growth rate (not the absolute numbers yet) for all Saregama music channels. is the fastest in the market.\n\nApart from the work that we people are doing on the way we select music, data analytics, predictive models and decentralized decision-taking process, I think the other big key is the\n\nPage 4 of 20",

I have stated in the past, even while the QIP was being done when I was asked a lot that why do we believe we have a chance to win. And I said that one of the big reasons is the old partnerships we have with most of the production houses. We people had procured music from the same production houses when maybe their grandfather or the parents of the current generation were working. And we have been paying royalty to them for a very long time. So, there is an innate belief in the fairness with which Saregama deals with the market.\n\nWhat is the net result? Today, whether it is Dharma, which is Karan Johar\u2019s Production House or Sanjay Leela Bhansali or Vidhu Vinod Chopra or Mythri which is the producer of the movie Pushpa, all of those people are very comfortable dealing with Saregama and have granted the music of their films to us.\n\nAgain, repeating 48% of Saregama\u2019s revenue comes from music which has been released after 2000, unbelievable even for us.\n\nThis year saw us taking the leadership position in the new content. And the criteria of leadership is views generated on YouTube through new content. We are already the number one player right now in Telugu, Malayalam, Bhojpuri, and Gujarati. This year as we people move ahead, we plan to take leadership position in Hindi and Tamil also.",

Also, the first song of Vicky Kaushal and Sara Ali Khan\u2019s \u2018Zara Hatke Zara Bachke\u2019 was released two days ago. We are expecting songs of the Ranveer Singh,-Alia Bhatt Karan Johar movie \u2018Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani\u2019 to release in the month of June. Even if I look at the other languages, this year is going to see big releases including Ajay Devgan\u2019s \u2018Maidaan\u2019, Vicky Kaushal\u2019s other movie called \u2018Rola\u2019 and Tamil Superstar Surya\u2019s two films.

So, you are going to be seeing big numbers. Yes, obviously there has been an immediate impact of that on the financials too, both on the revenue side and the cost side. For that matter if I look at our Quarter 1 FY'24, our content cost may just be double of what we people paid last year. But you will start seeing the impact of that on the revenue immediately.\n\nThis is new content, and we talk a lot about new content. But I also want to share with you the amazing work which has been happening on the catalogue side. Now this is the older content we are talking about. We have shared this year in our Corporate Presentation the revenue growth that we have seen over the last four years, in all our catalogue music, basis the decade of their release.\n\nNow why will people go out and listen to the older music?

Many of them are paid, many are free, barter deals, all kind of work is going on ensuring that the younger generation keeps on getting exposed to this older music. But an even bigger job happening is that we are creating versions of this music which make these older songs even more relevant to the younger crowd.\n\nNow whether it was a \u2018Mera Dil Yeh Pukare Aaja\u2019 which became a huge phenomenon around seven months back or the \u2018Nadiya Ke Paar\u2019 song \u2018Kaun Disa Mein\u2019 which is now a huge phenomenon. These are Lo-fi versions, Trap Mix version, Acoustic versions or Dance Covers. This new age content which is basis the older content only is being released typically on a zero upfront cost. We ask creator economy to create content for us only on a royalty sharing basis, we typically end up giving 10% royalties to all these people which is now resulting on some high-quality content coming to us and in large numbers.\n\nWe have also opened up a consumer scheme whereby we are inviting every bathroom singer in this country to start sending their own versions of the big Saregama songs, retro songs. And all these are then uploaded on a special YouTube channel. And whatever money is made by us, we share 10% royalties with them. So, suddenly you have somebody sitting in Meerut or Jabalpur or Ujjain also now getting a chance to sing \u2018Lag Jaa Gale\u2019 or \u2018Mere Sapno Ki Rani Kab Ayegi Tu\u2019, This game is about quantity also. The day since they create the content, one, they get invested in that content and they listen to the content that much more on streaming applications then they create their own version, they tell their friends, families, some of those versions breakout and everybody makes money out of it.",

    "text": "What is the net-net impact? Imagine the music which was created and released by us in 80s or 90s has also grown by over 19% on revenue perspective in the Financial Year '23. So, this year was 19%, last year was single digit but the fact of life is, these are 40, 50-year-old songs. For last four years, every year we have seen growth in the money that we are making even from our catalogue. So, while we keep on investing in newer content and keep this company ready for 2050 at the same time, we will not let go of any opportunity to make more money from the catalogue.\n\nOne other part I want to inform you is that, whenever we create a new version of a song, take any song, for example, \u2018Jumma Chumma\u2019, the new song ends up getting a fresh copyright life. So, if the newer song becomes popular that means you are keeping the older song alive through the new songs in that 60-year sound recording copyright life that starts getting included. Publishing Rights are anyway moving right now on a much longer basis.\n\nSo, it is a win-win situation, this entire endeavor of pushing more and more of the catalogue music. And it\u2019s not happening by a chance., We have new content departments within the company., So there is a Bhojpuri team which is separate, Hindi is separate, Bengali is separate, Gujarati is separate, Tamil is separate, Telugu is separate here so there are people in charge.\n\nPage 6 of 20",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited May 19, 2023\n\nSimilarly, now we have a full-fledged catalogue team whose only job is to create versions of this and find innovative ways to go out there and market it.\n\nFY '23 also saw at the industry level a big resolution of an old conflict that we were constantly having with singers. Their association called ISRA has been at loggerheads with music labels about an old conflict. We have thankfully been able to resolve it at the later part of the last financial year. The good part now is that ISRA will not be reaching out to any of the customers now. These customers are our digital customers or a hotel or a wedding which were approached earlier by music labels for the sound recording right and by IPRS for the publishing right, both ways we were making money.\n\nNow ISRA was also asking money for the separate rights which was creating some amount of disturbance in the market. And more importantly the two stakeholders who have to work together were working in conflict.\n\nThankfully, with the blessing of Honorable Minister Piyush Goyalji we have been able to resolve this issue once and for all. Now instead of a conflict, singers work with us. The deal is that they will be paid 25% of all the public performance revenue that we create. What is public performance revenue? The money that we collect from a hotel or from an event or a function or wedding or a concert, 25% of that money is now going to flow to singers. But singers in turn are going to work with us and ensure that the overall public performance revenue goes up.\n\nSo, if the initial month is anything to go by, we are already seeing that the royalty hit that we will end up getting, because of this 25% of public performance revenue going to them, will be more than compensated by an increase in the public performance revenue.",

    "text": "Anyway, the short-term problem of this royalty payout has been that entire FY '23 royalty payout to singers got booked in Quarter 4. One of the reasons why you will see Quarter 4 margins looking a little lower compared to Quarter 3, because the entire royalty payout for the 12 months has happened in a single quarter. But as we go forward, the royalty payments are going to be happening on a quarterly basis.\n\nDoes this mean that the overall royalty payout that Saregama talks about between 12% to 15% will go up? Good news is no. As a percentage also, the increase that we people will have because of the royalty payouts for singers, more than gets compensated by the reduction in the royalty that we are paying for the newer content. This is because more and more of new content coming on the regional side is procured on a one-time payment basis and zero royalty is attributed to them. So, if you look at our numbers also, you will see that Quarter 4 royalties have gone up as a percentage because of one-time payment of all the four quarters hitting in a single quarter. But if you see it on an annual level our royalty payouts have come down as a percentage.\n\nMy last part in music will be missing if I don\u2019t talk about the play of Artificial Intelligence. There are various views being taken on how AI is going to be affecting the industry. We want\n\nPage 7 of 20",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited May 19, 2023\n\nto be ahead of the curve, we for the last 12 months or so have been building our own understanding and a knowledge bank on the world of AI. We are working with some of the leading institutions in this space and investing a lot internally on the relevant manpower so that we are ahead of the curve.\n\nWe are actually pretty excited about the value AI will bring into a content creation company like ours. It can help us with the huge database of songs that we people are sitting on, literally the golden catalogue of music in this country. We are in a great position to allow the AI learning engine to learn on our stuff and help us predict even better as to what kind of music is going to be working in which genre.\n\nWe believe our investments which were done on data analytics are helping us today to have a better success rate than any other player in the market. And our investments which are going in the area of Artificial Intelligence are going to help us a lot in the two to three years to come.\n\nCarvaan, our retail business, maintained its growth trajectory during the year. On the unit basis it grew by 40% odd to touch a sale of 5.6 lakhs during the year, compared to the 4 lakh sale that we did last year. It actually helped us write a very small positive margin this year. But I think the more heartening part for us is that this is the fourth year in a row that there has been no marketing and still the brand is able to keep on growing up purely basis its own consumer pull.\n\nYes, the large contributor of the sales driver this year for Carvaan has been the Carvaan Mobile which allowed us to grow at a lower price point which also explains why the revenue growth in Carvaan is lower than the unit sales growth because Carvaan Mobile is coming at a lower price point. But overall, we maintain our positive outlook towards Carvaan numbers. We will continue pushing Carvaan in the market here without putting any major marketing efforts behind it.",

Now there is enough amount of data sitting out there with us which has proved a causal relationship between the songs which are put on Carvaan and the song which are growing at the fastest rate on the streaming platforms. Let me clarify when we say we put 5000 songs in a Carvaan, they are not our biggest 5000 songs. Say, there are 5000 Hindi songs from the total 38000 odd songs. So, they do justice to all the singers whose station has been created or all the composers whose stations have been created within Carvaan. They are not necessarily our Top-5000 songs.\n\nWe saw data which is very clearly saying whichever songs we are putting in Carvaan, grew the fastest on digital also. We were surprised by this and did a lot of qualitative study here and we came back to the conclusion now that most songs on Carvaan heard, by the middle-aged and the older people are not through earphones or headphones. They use it as a speaker and keep it on during the daytime. There is a lot of passive listening of those great older songs being done also by the younger age group. Many of the songs are liked by that generation a lot, because now\n\nPage 8 of 20",

And they start growing a fascination and a liking for those songs, end up consuming those songs that much more on streaming platforms.\n\nSo, Carvaan has been playing this big role for us from catalogue marketing perspective too. That doesn\u2019t mean we will ever allow Carvaan to get into losses. This world of Carvaan that we are in, will always be a breakeven or hopefully, like we saw this year, will have a small contribution margin.\n\nThe Film, Series and Events vertical touched the highest ever revenue this year. It crossed Rs. 150 crores in FY '23. Let me talk about each of these three verticals in detail. Movie business, started around five to six years ago. has now started delivering steady profits. We have been able to establish our reputation in the market. The volume that we have allows us to get all the cost optimization done. So, both on the cost side, the volume is helping us, on the revenue side since we have now an established reputation, we are able to ensure a decent margin for ourselves.\n\nThis was in fact the first year where the focus moved more on the actual release of our theatrical films. We released two of our Malayalam films and one Punjabi film in the theatre, and we got very good reaction. I am happy to share with you that one of our film called \u2018Agra\u2019 -an unreleased film - actually got selected in the Super Prestigious Directors' Fortnight at Cannes' this year. So, my team is sitting out there in Cannes as is half of the Bollywood world where the movie premier is going to be happening in the Directors' Fortnight, it\u2019s a very big thing. Very few movies end up getting selected at the Cannes' Directors' Fortnight levels. It just shows that the path that we people have chosen in terms of creating good quality commercial cinema is working out.",

We are not going to be taking big risks and will work only on those films, regional films where we can secure a large part of our revenue through Digital & TV Rights sale.\n\nComing to the Web Series business, we finally after working for many years were able to get a break in the web series business and we have successfully released two of our web series. First is the series called \u2018Hunter\u2019 with Suniel Shetty, and the second is the series called \u2018United Kacche\u2019 with Sunil Grover. Both were released on the digital platforms this year. As these were our first series releases, we were not able to get enough breaks on the series side. We have just put our best foot forward which means that we have literally released these on a cost recovery model basis. We did not keep margins with ourselves because we wanted to show to the world that we can create high quality content.\n\nI want to give you guys comfort that we have not written losses here, but this is literally on a cost basis that these two series have gone out. We are very hopeful that for both these series there is a high probability either we get a second season or looking at this series, somebody else may end up giving further number of series across to us. So, it\u2019s a good start which has happened\n\nPage 9 of 20",

In the long run, as the reputation starts building up in series business too, we will very comfortably end up making a 15% margin.\n\nThe third vertical which was literally given life in this financial year was the Events vertical. We did multiple concerts with Diljit Dosanjh at the global level. This was absolutely the first time for us in India, U.S., Canada. And we also launched our musical IP called 'Disco Dancer- The Musical'. I have been saying this for last four quarters now, our events business is where, our films business or new music business or Carvaan business was six to seven years ago. We are in the stage where we are just establishing this business. There will be losses that will be written in the short term on this, but as we people go forward in the 12 to 18 months horizon, we will be able to start writing positive margins. And the leverage this gives us in our music business anyway is the icing on the cake.\n\nBut to give you guys comfort, I want to state something else also which is an internal policy which we will share with you now. While we continue to grow our films series and events vertical, we will be extremely cautious in our approach as we people take it forward. Our internal policy is very clear on it that the total capital allocation, to Film, Series and Events business will never exceed 18% of the capital deployed at any particular time in the company.\n\nSo, there are various checks and balances which are sitting in place out here. Only once we get our comfort, if we ever change this capital allocation policy, we will come back to you people. But at this juncture, we are very confident that we should be able to grow this business vertical at over 25% year-on-year and write- a profit. Films are profitable, series should get profitable as we people expect, it\u2019s cost plus only. Events vertical in the next 12 to 18 months will turn positive.",

Like it has become a norm here, all the serials end up becoming a slot leader from the word go. Both these serials are doing extremely well on Sun TV and leading their respective slots on the Tamil TV content side. And like always we people own the IP of all these serials we are creating for Sun TV.This puts us in the unique position of being the only production house which can go out and claim this.\n\nSo, ladies and gentlemen, a great year for us on all the verticals of ours - music licensing, music retailing, films, events and series. I will be happy to take any questions from your side now.\n\nModerator: Thank you very much, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. We have the first question from the line of Bala Murali from Oman Investment Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nBala Murali: I want to know about this film side business and how many films we are planning to release in this financial year? And are there any films which satellite rights are due and about to be renewed this year?\n\nPage 10 of 20",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited May 19, 2023\n\nVikram Mehra: The kind of films that we will be releasing during the year are listed in our Corporate Presentation. Our focus continues being Malayalam and Punjabi only. We are expecting anything between six to eight films to be released during the year, which are all at various stages of production at this moment. All I can share with you philosophically we believe the work of film is in a fashion that most of them gets secured by the TV Rights. I would not be able to share specific data about which films rights have been sold or not. Films business is a ~15% margin after charging off full costs.\n\nBala Murali: I am asking about that already the content of films which you have, any films satellite rights due in the current year or coming year, so that\u2019s what I am asking?\n\nVikram Mehra: Of the first set of movies that were put on the digital platforms , the rights of couple of movies that came out of the digital platforms have moved to another digital platform. That\u2019s all I am at a liberty to say. So, the second round of monetization of some of our earliest films have just started. As you know the TV Rights, the deals typically happen for a much longer duration, so none of our movies have come out of that yet. Remember our film business is only a five-year- old business.\n\nBala Murali: And lastly on the margin side what would be the projections for this current financial year, how much we can expect?\n\nVikram Mehra: On to our adjusted EBITDA percentage of 32 to 33. Don\u2019t look at this number on a quarterly basis. On an annual basis, adjusted EBITDA, we have been stating this is in the range of 32% to 33% and we stick to that.\n\nModerator: Thank you. We have the next question from the line of Bhupendra Tiwary from ICICI Securities. Please go ahead.",

But the fact is that we have a strong new content releases this year. So, does that change our stance on the guidance of course the long term and medium- term kind of visibility is 20% to 25%. But does that change that course for FY'24?\n\nVikram Mehra: No, it does not. We will hold on to these numbers only. Please understand the way our deals are also structured; you don\u2019t get the impact of a new content release overnight. If you are in a fixed fee deal with somebody, say with short format apps or TV channels, you don\u2019t get the impact immediately, and you will have to wait for the one-year cycle to get over before you start seeing the upside on the revenue part. On platforms like YouTube, you see the impact immediately. So, we will hold on to this number of 22% to 25% only at this moment.\n\nBhupendra Tiwary: Now the second question is you alluded to the fact that six out of the nine streaming platforms have turned into paid format. So, just wanted to understand what is our kind of revenues, I\n\nPage 11 of 20\n\nSaregama India Limited May 19, 2023\n\nunderstand its low but what\u2019s the kind of percentage there in terms of subscription part.

If it\u2019s a free customer of any OTT streaming application who is listening to the latest Arijit song, on an average we get paid 10 paisa, on the nine platforms. Assume you are a paid customer of any of these platforms and suppose you paid Rs. 100 as your monthly charge to that platform because you are a paid customer who does not want to listen to advertisements., then the deals are this way that whatever you have paid, which is Rs. 100, 50% of that money is going to be earmarked as what they call content pool. So, in Rs. 100, 50 bucks becomes content pool. This will be divided equally amongst all the songs that you heard during the month.\n\nThe average customer listens to around 66 songs. Suppose you heard 100 songs in the month which means every song will be worth 50 paisa. Now assume India is not a Rs. 100 per month economy, it may be a Rs. 50 per month economy, possibly. In that case every song becomes equal to 25 paisa. Now you can do your math, how big a jump it\u2019s going to be as streaming services keep on moving towards pay.",

So free usage will start to fall down and pay will start building up. But as I have shared in my Corporate Presentation, it was a very interesting graph of how the paid subscribers based globally has moved over the last eight to 10 years. It shows steady numbers in which paid starts moving up once a platform decides that enough of free, we want to move towards pay. The good news is, in India, the piracy incidents in the larger towns have fallen dramatically so the consumer base of the streaming platforms in Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, Bangalore, Jaipur and Ahmedabad start saying, \u201cI want to turn into a paid customer if you come at a reasonable fee. I have anything between Rs. 50 to Rs. 100 per month.\u201d There will be many people who will start moving towards the paid model.\n\nBhupendra Tiwary: And in terms of margin when we say about will maintain the EBITDA before content charge of 32%. So, now the thing is I just wanted to clarify this year we will also see big content charges hitting into the balance sheet. I understand we look at the steady state is without content charge how is the margins, but is it fair to assume that this year while the revenue growth will also be reported kind of EBITDA might look lower because of the content charge?\n\nVikram Mehra: Content charge comes below the adjusted EBITDA.\n\nBhupendra Tiwary: So, that\u2019s why I am saying so I understand the EBITDA before content charge guidance, but for below part this year might look because the content charge is hitting high.\n\nVikram Mehra: See the whole part is, if the incremental revenue given by the new content is lower than the charge connected to that new content then you are right. So, let\u2019s talk about absolute numbers\n\nPage 12 of 20",

    "text": "Vikram Mehra:\n\nFirst, let me acknowledge that we have not been able to pick catalogues primarily because they were coming at a valuation which was not making sense. We believe that was not value accretive. Just because we had the money did not mean we should go and pick up catalogues at any price at which they were available. In fact, there is no catalogue deal that has happened anywhere in the market apart from the one single deal that we had done.\n\nWe are also now revising the model, earlier our entire thought process was that we will just go and pick up catalogues. Now we are also looking at picking up minority stakes, moving to an absolute majority in regional music companies allowing the regional label to run with the company for next two, three, five years. So, we come with the minority now, we help them out and then pick up the majority or an absolute number in the next three to five years. So, that\u2019s another model we are looking at. And I am hopeful that we will be able to go back and strike deals. But one thing I am again assuring you just because the money is sitting with us, we are not going to pick up catalogue at bizarre prices.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Dhruv Rathod from Solidarity Investment Managers. Please go ahead.\n\nDhruv Rathod: Actually, I had a few questions as the telecom companies focus on the ARPU growth, right. And they will be taking mobile data prices up. So, do you see that impacting our music label business, if audio or video streaming would drop?",

If for five minutes I tell you that I want to pause this call, almost 70% to 80% of everybody on this phone call right now is going to take out their mobile phone. Even if nobody has sent them a message on WhatsApp they will still take out their mobile phone and they will try to kill their time by watching something, if nothing else than an Instagram feed.\n\nWe as Indians don\u2019t know what to do even with two minutes you are free with us, apart from taking out our phone and consuming something.

Also, you just see what\u2019s happening on the television part . There are 22 million connected televisions which are active on a monthly basis now. I am an ex-Tata Sky person and I never imagined that connected television is going to become a way of life for people like us. So, that\u2019s your upper strata of society, the lower strata of society are going to continue watching everything on the mobile phone. So, with 10%, 20%, 30% increase in the data rate, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to impact the content consumption at all.\n\nDhruv Rathod: And the second question was around as like we know interest rates have been rising globally and startups are seeing challenges in raising equity funding at that point. So, are we seeing any slowdown in YouTube ad revenues because of this?\n\nVikram Mehra: Actually, that\u2019s a funny part we saw a slowdown last year for two quarters, which was when the startup revenues were coming down. But they got more than compensated by the FMCG increase, durables increase, and services increase. So, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to write right over 23% increase in our music licensing revenue if YouTube numbers had fallen down. YouTube revenue which is from music and even my TV serial business is dependent on advertising, we have not seen a slowdown honestly only startup money is not there.\n\nDhruv Rathod: Lastly what is the share of music label revenues from YouTube in FY'23?\n\nVikram Mehra: We don\u2019t give vertical wise, but if I look at all the three verticals of digital, which is music streaming, video streaming and short format apps they together for us are anything between 70% to 75%.",

Please go ahead.\n\nCA Garvit Goyal:\n\nSo, the point here is on despite having a significant presence in industry and good management experience, why we are not able to utilize the capital in efficient manner. Similar thing that we have yet to decide with what to do with that Rs. 750 crore of fund raised that even after one and half years. So, means we raised it to add some value for the shareholders and since last one and a half year we did not make any material announcements, means I am not understanding that there was a plan at that time there should having some progress on that, I think it\u2019s wrong for shareholders, company raising fund citing that we don\u2019t want to lose on the opportunity. And those opportunities disappear even after one and half years.\n\nPage 14 of 20\n\nSaregama India Limited May 19, 2023\n\nSo, please throw some light on exactly what is happening, and we are actually lacking particularly focusing on that QIP utilizations? And this Film segment as well, that is ultimately that is deteriorating our bottom-line.",

    "text": "Vikram Mehra:\n\nI repeated this, and Bhupendra asked me the same question. I am not going to run away from the fact that apart from one catalogue we have not been able to buy any other music catalogue out in the market because they were coming at multiples that would have hurt the shareholder valuation right now for Saregama as a company. It did not make sense to pay those kinds of multiples. The negotiation position becomes at times a little difficult when the other party knows that you are under pressure to go and utilize your funds. They think they can get away with higher prices and did not make financial sense to us.\n\nSo, I acknowledge it, accept it that we have not been able to deploy funds at the rate that we would have liked to . Howsoever, tempting it may be for us we will not utilize these funds for any vertical apart from music. These funds were not picked up for my retail business or films business or events business, which are all getting funded right now out of the internal accruals itself. We will keep these funds and look at various aspects on the music side alone, saying how do I use these funds in ways in which it can help the music business to grow.\n\nI am reasonably hopeful this year you will see under the new structure that we are ready to work with, whereby we are ready to come as a minority player and then give a chance to the owner of that company to build value, in that company and then buyout absolute majority in time. Under those models we should have some successful deals happening this year.",

    "text": "CA Garvit Goyal: And on product mix side so basically our product mix is changing like film and publication, have contributed approx. 18% to our revenues in FY'22 now it is I think 23% around. So, but these segments cumulatively doing only 2% to 3% of whatever revenues they are generating so my question is, is it going to be in the same way for us going forward or are we going to improve it before if the station doesn\u2019t change, then we will see further decline in our ROCEs?.\n\nVikram Mehra:\n\nAgain, as announced, the first publishing business has already been announced is being demerged out of the company. So, I did speak about it in my opening comments that we are just awaiting the final go ahead from NCLT and the publishing business gets demerged as part of a demerged entity. So, that will not be there with us.\n\nRegarding the other two businesses, the nature of all the business is not going to be like music business but we want to be there in other businesses also because they are symbiotic businesses to music business. Our films business will remain a 15% to 20% margin business, but the good part is we are not allocating more than 18% of our total capital out there, at any particular time for the film business. Most of our money will be allocated only to the music business, which is the highest margin business.\n\nCA Garvit Goyal: So, can\u2019t we consider demerging this film segment as well?\n\nPage 15 of 20",

It gives you a huge edge in the music business if you also control the films.\n\nCA Garvit Goyal: And you mentioned huge cost are coming in our P&L this particular year and incremental revenue is also likely to match those costs. So, overall, this year likely to be EPS accretive for the shareholders or we can say it can be a muted one?\n\nVikram Mehra: The only future numbers that we are giving here is music licensing revenue should grow anything between 22% to 25%, Films, Series, Events business will be growing around 25% during the year. Events business will remain under pressure, but the quantum is not going to be that big. Carvaan business will remain between a breakeven to a very small margin business. Our adjusted EBITDA for the company should be anything between 32% to 33%.\n\nCA Garvit Goyal: And last one is, basically we did QIP and since then amount was invested in Mutual Funds, so these are the debt oriented mutual funds or equity oriented mutual funds?\n\nVikram Mehra: Debt only , our bigger criteria is to secure the capital.\n\nModerator: Thank you. The next question from the line of Ravi Kumar Naredi from Naredi Investment Pvt. Ltd. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Kumar Naredi: My question and my concern is that when we raise fund from QIP our market cap is not rising, please use this fund so fast so we may get suitable return from that investment.\n\nVikram Mehra: Done sir, that\u2019s my biggest KRA also, but I will again say that it doesn\u2019t mean that I will buy it at any rates, that\u2019s a very wrong way and a short-term way of looking at it.",

    "text": "Vikram Mehra: Yes, so more than easing out see the moment there is a structural change that we are ready to do, where we are telling the label that you may be selling it; you may believe you are selling it at a lower price now, but you have a chance to use these funds to make your company big and sell the majority of the stake may be at a much better valuation later. That model is something that a lot of people are appreciating and understanding. So, I would like to believe that some of the people will agree. This is just the catalogue part. There are all kinds of companies which are there on the music side, where we can go out there and get into acquisition deals, which will help overall the space of this music world for us. There is content acquisition and there is this content marketing, both the parts are very important and increasingly we are seeing a large amount of our content acquisition money actually going towards our marketing side. So, we are looking at all the possibilities now. We are just widening the scope, the only conditions that we people work on is it has to be connected to the world of music for us and second it has to be shareholder value accretive.\n\nDevanshu Sampat: And can you give me a sense of how your Top 5 or Top 10 songs contributes, the new songs that\u2019s obviously I believe would be adding to your top-line every year. So, is there like a very high concentration that happens specially with the new songs that come out, is there some idea you can give?\n\nVikram Mehra: All I can tell you right now is our new songs are doing very well and you can check out my corporate presentation where we have shared raw data.\n\nDevanshu Sampat: No, I have seen two-decade gap over here, I am talking about something specific which really people are listening to, let\u2019s say released in the last three to six months that would be helpful?\n\nPage 18 of 20\n\nVikram Mehra:",

    "text": "Saregama India Limited May 19, 2023\n\nNo, but those songs that I have shared there, so are you asking me the actual revenue or are you asking me which songs have done well?\n\nDevanshu Sampat: No, I am asking you the revenue that comes from the Top 10.\n\nVikram Mehra: I am in this market right now, if I start sharing every song revenue that I am making how will I survive and do my business dealings . So, I am telling you now that what percentage of my overall revenue is coming from new content, . How is my catalogue growing by which you can arrive how my new content is growing- you have got that number also. I am giving you how many new songs I released and how many of those songs are sitting in the top charts of the country, which are Spotify charts. So, I have given you lots of information at this juncture for you to form an opinion of the quality of music that we people are hearing.\n\nDevanshu Sampat: And last question, do you have any sense on the growth of the user base how it has changed post the streaming platforms once they start charging, once they move to that paid model, do you have any sense, can you give a sense of how the numbers have changed?\n\nVikram Mehra: I can just hazard a guess on the profile of the customer. Obviously the urban customer, that are slightly better off and more educated is moving to pay subscription faster. You have people in their 20s who move to paid subscription faster than people in their teens or people in their 40s. You have South Indian states that move to paid subscription faster than you have the North Indian states. So, those levels of broad definitions are there, but overall, we know when the switch happens from somebody allowing all the content available freely versus saying listen you need to pay, there will be an immediate drop that happens and then it starts building up once again. The platforms that have taken a call they are moving towards paid, they are going through that kind of a transitional journey.",

Please go ahead.\n\nShubham Ajmera: I just wanted to know about the potential impact on our business in the event of online streaming platform facing financial difficultly or going bankrupt, because of these changes or something like, since they are moving to the fully paid subscription model now?\n\nVikram Mehra: If a particular platform goes out there and shuts shop, or is in financial distress, is not able to go out and invest, whatever the reason maybe the customer will not stop listening to music they will move to whichever platform that\u2019s offering it. We went through this part right in our last financial year. A couple of platforms were having issues in terms of going paid and not having the monies, you have not seen the revenues falling down. We just released a Vicky Kaushal song sung by Arijit two days ago, and that song has already clocked numbers in lakhs on a daily basis. If the customer does not get it on one platform he will kill that platform go the second platform. So, we don\u2019t see too much stress happening out here if couple of platforms shut down.\n\nPage 19 of 20\n\nModerator:\n\nSaregama India Limited May 19, 2023\n\nThank you. As that was the last question for today, with that we conclude today\u2019s conference call. On behalf of ICICI Securities that concludes this conference. Thank you for joining us and you may now disconnect your lines.\n\nPage 20 of 20",
