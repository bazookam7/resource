    "text": "Vikram Mehra:\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. This is Vikram Mehra. The quarter 3 for FY24 saw operating revenues of INR 204 crores and PBT of INR 70 crores. I've spent over 9 years at Saregama and every quarter we are, getting more and more clearer about what business we are in and how we're going to reach our final target.\n\nIf I have to summarize in a single line about our strategy and what we want to do, it is to create IP and then monetize that IP. That's the only business we are in and will continue to be. The IP creation can be across audio and video, which includes music as well as film, series or short- format content.\n\nOn IP, monetization is primarily done through licensing deals to third-party platforms. It also extends to monetisation of artistes who create these IP, and it\u2019s done through brand endorsements and live events.\n\nSo over time, what we create and how we monetize would have got changed, but the fact that we will focus only on creation and monetization, and not getting into the services business is very, very clear. Secondly, we don't want to sit on the laurels of the past catalogue that we have. Nonetheless, if we decide tomorrow that we don't want to invest in new content, we can easily draw very heavy margins from catalogue content. But consciously, as a management team and our board we want to prepare this company for 20 years down the line and not just for the next 2 to 3 years.\n\nLet me start with the first vertical music licensing. This vertical has been growing at 23% CAGR for the last 5 years. As I mentioned in our last 2 calls, this year has seen a lot of pressure on the OTT audio side. Many of the platforms being under financial pressure have decided to move from free to paid.\n\nThis, actually, in the long run is very good news for us. All the labels have joined hands and are, in fact, helping the platforms in their journey. We have removed our conditions on minimum",

But there are short-term pains because of that.\n\nPlatforms moved to pay and the minimum guarantees going away, resulted into revenues on the OTT side being under serious pressure. We have been able to balance it to some extent by higher numbers in the other verticals but overall, there is pressure on the music side.\n\nThe good news is that all the pressure is practically going to get factored in financial year '24 itself. After this, we would have reached a base whereby anything from now onwards is going to be positive journey only resulting in similar growth rates that we have seen in the past from music licensing.\n\nIf you look at the global data for, OTT audio and video, which means normal streaming platforms as well a platform like YouTube have grown by 34% in calendar year '23. And India is finally showing the highest volume growth globally on audio streaming as well as audio plus video streaming of Music.\n\nPlease keep this in mind that India's growth is coming only on the back of just 200 million people streaming audio and some 350 million people streaming video. It means there's still a huge headroom of growth in terms of usage lying ahead of us.\n\nAll that we need to see now over the next 12 to 18 months is this base of users finally going behind a paywall and generating revenue for the platforms as well as labels. It has happened internationally. It's bound to happen in India. It's happening on the video streaming space in India. It will eventually start happening in the space of audio streaming too, give it 12 to 18 months.",

    "text": "This quarter saw the music release of Vidhu Vinod Chopra's 12th Fail, a movie which has won every accolade, and the music is doing very, very well. In Tamil, we had Dhanush's Captain Miller's music getting released; in Telugu, we had superstar Venkatesh\u2019s movie Saindhav, getting released.\n\nIn Malayalam, we had Mohan Lal's Malaikottai Vaaliban's music getting released. We also released one of the rarest non-film songs that Arijit has done outside the film industry called Dil Haareya, which did very well for us. We had multiple songs by Bhojpuri superstar Neelkamal and by Gujarati number one star Rakesh Barot getting released.\n\nBut if you ask me, I think the greatest story for us has been a song released by India's biggest rapper called Divine. A year ago, nobody would have thought that someone like Divine is going to work with Saregama. Also, it's not just a song he has released but he has also agreed to do a concert tour across India with Saregama.\n\nSo, we have a twin relationship going on with him, on the live-event side and the music side. It's fulfilling the objective that we have been trying to pursue over the last few months - to make the brand younger and get more younger artists to work with us. Whether it's the Pocket Aces acquisition, or the fact that we are coming out with the latest Bollywood releases has helped change our image and profile in the industry.",

    "text": "Page 3 of 21\n\nSaregama India Limited February 09, 2024\n\nAnother very popular rapper in India, Krishna. released a song with us in the month of January.\n\nThe songs of the quarter 2 releases Zara Hatke Zara Bachke or Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani in Hindi, or Kushi in Telugu or RDX in Malayalam continue to do very, very well in quarter 3 also. If I look at our lineup for the next 12 months, which is a litmus test for all of us, are we able to generate enough amount of new content? We want to work with the best in the market in every major language.\n\nLet me share the lineup which is one of the best lineups you can think of. We have three Dharma Production (Karan Johar) films that are releasing over the next 7, 8 months. One of them is an Alia's film while the second is a Vicky Kaushal and Tripti Dimri film. Further, there are 4 Jio Studio films that we will be releasing over this time including Stree 2 and Akshay Kumar's Sky Force.\n\nThen there is Ajay Devgan's Maidan, and Diljit Dosanjh and A R Rahman's Chamkila getting released. In Kannada too, we have acquired music of a couple of superstar movies, Darshan\u2019s Devil . And Sudeep Kiccha's Max.\n\nIn Malayalam, we have Mammootty's Bazooka's music coming out. In Tamil, we have Suriya\u2019s fantasy film, Kanguva. It is creating lot of hype and publicity there. Its music is sitting with us. And I think one of the biggest wills be the Telugu film, Game Changer, starring Ram Charan and Kiara Advani directed by Shankar. Ram Charan is doing his first big film after the award- winning RRR, while veteran Shankar is making a film after a very, very long time.\n\nIn Punjabi, 2 film music albums of the No.1 star Gippy, Warning 2 and Shinda Shinda No Papa is with us.",

We want to dominate all the regional languages, which will give us a good negotiation position when we talk to all the platforms. But yes, with all the investment that we have been making, the content charge off which includes just the content charge off and the corresponding marketing has gone up by 54% year-on-year.\n\nI'll repeat, we are in a transitional state. Our content spends are not going up in a linear fashion. Post QIP, we were clear, we are going to step up our investments in content not in an incremental fashion, but in a step jump fashion. This means in the short run, the investments will go up very, very steeply, which will result into revenues, just about matching the content charge-offs that we are taking.\n\nGive it another 18 months or so, and you will start seeing that the incremental revenues we are getting from these investments will start far outweighing the charge-offs that we are taking corresponding to the newer content.\n\nWe went from a company which was not investing in content to a company which is now taking pole position in all the languages. So, this is the transitional time that we are going through. The absolute numbers on profits are never going to dip. In the short run, they will continue to go up, but they will go up far more steeply after another 18 months or so.",

    "text": "Page 4 of 21\n\nSaregama India Limited February 09, 2024\n\nWith all the new investments, we are holding on to our internal guideline as well as guidance to you that the payback periods have to be 5 years. The language mix is decided keeping in mind a payback period of 5 years. And post that, you have another 55 to 75 years left in front of you to keep on making money from these songs. Remember, Lag Jaa Gale is already a 60-year-old song, and we are still making money from it.\n\nWhile we invest in new content, we continue working on our catalogue, both on promoting our existing songs using Instagram or ensuring those songs are made available in some of the newer movies that are coming out. We are using technology in a big fashion to push these songs. Also, we are creating a lot of versions of these songs. Whether it's the tech-based lo-fi versions or asking the new age artists to reimagine and recreate the songs and then promote these songs using Instagram. All of this is giving a new lease of life to the catalogue, and this work will continue happening.\n\nThere is enough amount of precedence that we see at the global level done by some of the biggest music companies whom we very closely follow and learn from. And we are realizing a lot of money can be made from the catalogue. If I go by the last 3 years' track record, our catalogue has been comfortably growing at 12% per annum, and I don't see any reason why it will get hit over the next 12 to 18 months. Once the OTT platforms start moving behind the paywall, I see catalogue easily managing 14% to 16% growth.\n\nThe new vertical under music licensing, is artist management. There, we have signed up artists and then we make them popular by placing them in our IP releases. Majority of them are music, but we are also using the power of our IP releases on the short format side, which is housed in Pocket Aces or maybe putting some of them under Yoodlee Films.",

And whatever money the artist makes, Saregama gets a share of it.\n\nSo, it's an interesting model. We are making songs with them, which are anyway paying for themselves. But rather than using random people right now for our songs, we sign up artists and work only with them in the songs. So, the money comes not only from the songs, but by also monetizing the artist itself. We currently have 123-odd artists, under Pocket Aces and 15, under Saregama .\n\nAs the investment in new IP increases, we see these artists becoming bigger as a result of this , allowing us to make more money. Remember, digital advertising is growing at 31% per annum and we believe a large chunk of this investment, which is moving to the digital side will finally start following artists/influencers.\n\nAnd the biggest beneficiary is Saregama, because Clout, our artist -influencer management business that we have under Pocket Aces is the number one player in this market. In fact, recently, they won the most innovative marketing agency at the Entrepreneurship Awards of 2023.",

    "text": "Page 5 of 21\n\nSaregama India Limited February 09, 2024\n\nAnd with Saregama and Pocket Aces coming together is going to give us a massive edge because compared to every other artist management agency who just manage the artists, we are the only ones who can give breaks to artists in our own content. For example, if an artist join works with Agency X, they may agree to give a margin A to them. But if they work with us, we can get, in fact, 2A margin from the artist because we are also aligning the artist to feature in the music video/film/web series that we are doing. None of the other artist management agencies have a content business going on.\n\nOverall, with a stated goal of acquiring 25% to 30% of all new music which is getting released in India, we are confident that our music licensing business, should be able to double its revenues in the next 3 to 3.5 years. And all this new content that we are talking about is going to be funded through our internal accruals or the QIP money.\n\nLet me now shift gears and move to the video vertical, where we make films under the brand name Yoodlee. Digital content under the Dice brand, which is a vertical under Pocket Aces. On Instagram, we make content under the brand name FilterCopy and Nutshell. It is the explosion in the smartphone penetration and the relatively cheaper data, which is the biggest driver of this vertical.\n\nWe are still in very early stages of video compared to music where we have got over 120 years of experience now. We believe over the next 5 years, we should be able to grow this vertical at a CAGR of 25%, And, in a stable state it should be able to give us a 15% margin.",

    "text": "The way our deal structuring is done, in terms of cash inflows and outflows, what I am happy to share with you is that a 15% margin will result into a 21% IRR on this business. And the only capital that you need here is more in the nature of working capital, which again is going to be managed through internal accruals or maybe a small line of credit.\n\nQuarter 3 saw the release of Crushed Season 3 and Half Love Half Arranged series from Pocket Aces (under the Dice brand) on Amazon. They were released by Pocket Aces before 11th of November, and the financial numbers you are seeing right now are only Pocket Aces numbers post-11 November. So, we don't have the benefit of the revenues of these two. I'm sharing this information just to tell you how strong our other business of Pocket Aces is.\n\nFilterCopy, the biggest youth Instagram channel -- that is owned by Saregama through Pocket Aces, actually completed over 1 billion views on Instagram between January to November of 2023, making it by far the biggest thing that you're seeing on Instagram today. It is resulting into lots of brands, now chasing FilterCopy to get their products integrated into the video, and we see this business growing manifold.\n\nThere was not too much of action happening on the Yoodlee side in quarter 3. Quarter 4, we'll see 2 Malayalam films and 2 Punjabi films getting released. The live events business of ours, whose primary objective is to support the music business, saw a successful Australia tour of Diljit Dosanjh. We also did a show with Javed Akhtar saheb on the stories behind the biggest songs that had ever been released. Everywhere, it's a music element, which is important working",

It also helps us get into deeper relationships with these artists, which facilitates more and more of their music coming across to us.\n\nIn the last call, I had spoken to you about the music learning app that we plan to launch, which will teach music fan how to sing or play instruments using artificial intelligence. All the hits\u2019 songs from Saregama from Lata Mangeshkar\u2019s Lag Jaa Gale to Arjit Singh's What Jhumka from Rocky and Rani Kii Prem Kahaani.will be taught using this app.\n\nAnd the best part is the people who do well in these courses, which are all going to be paid courses, will be given a chance to release a song or an album with Saregama. This is something that nobody else in the market can go back and support. Just like what we did many years ago with Carvaan, this will be one more way for us to monetize our incredible music library. We are hoping to launch this app sometime in March or April this year. And the way the app is being built, it seamlessly integrates with every other vertical we have in the company.\n\nOn the topic of technology, we are really going very heavy on converting all our older songs into Dolby Atmos or spatial audio. Over 2,500 songs have already been converted. The good news is that a lot of platforms like Apple are now incentivizing labels who are putting up their content in the newer format. Also, a presence in these newer formats means that more younger people are open to the idea of listening to older songs.",

    "text": "Carvaan saw a marginal decline in revenues this quarter. Though the unit sale numbers have gone up, we are selling more of the lower-priced units. This is a very conscious effort from our side. We have further reduced sales and marketing expenses that we are making on Carvaan. We are comfortable with the Carvaan revenues going down. , Strategically, as we move ahead, we are going to move Carvaan from a retail product to only an e-commerce selling product.\n\nOver the next 3- to 3.5 years, we would be investing over INR1,000 crores in new content, all coming out of our internal accruals and QIP money. This will not only contribute to the immediate growth but also put company on a long-term growth path. The only reason that we are number two and not number one in the music market today is because we did not invest enough between 2000 to , 2019.\n\nWe want to go back and correct that. While we are investing heavy, we will hold on to our absolute profitability in the first 12 to 18 months. After 18 months, you will start seeing a steep increase in profitability. And from year 3 onwards, you are then looking at a step function jump and investment going away and a linear increase happening, the profitability should go up in a significant fashion.\n\nIf I look at the overall revenue for the company, excluding Carvaan, to continue growing at 25%, 26% CAGR over a 3\u20135-year period. And the overall profitability (PBT) of the company, to double in the next 3 to 4 years. Both the music vertical and the video vertical are going to contribute to this.\n\nI'll reiterate -- it's easy for us to stop all investments and just focus on short-term profitability. We have taken a conscious call that's not the track that we are going to follow. We will invest heavy on content while ensuring that we maintain a short-term profitability. But in the midterm,",

As the subscription economy starts taking off in the next 18, 24 months, you will see lots of money being made. That is what is happening in every other part of the world.

So, the company, which is investing heavily, company that is using Artificial Intelligence to make the right content selection and has got technology to ensure there's no revenue leakage that's going to be the company, which is going to have the last laugh. And we are very confident that we are on track to be in that position.\n\nLastly, I'm thankful to the Board which has declared a 400% interim dividend. This is a way of thanking our investors for the faith and confidence they have shown in the company.\n\nThank you, and I'll be happy to take questions now.\n\nModerator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from the line of Pulkit Chawla from Emkay Global Financial Services Limited.\n\nPulkit Chawla: So just wanted some understanding in this transition of movement to a paid platform. Now assuming that these key players that have actually transitioned to the complete paid platform would not have had a major market share, the impact on your revenues seems to be quite decent. And particularly, your competitor hasn't really seen any impact there. So, is there any difference in the way they deal the structure here? So, could you throw some colour round this first?",

    "text": "Vikram Mehra: So let me not talk about competition, that's wrong on my part. All I can tell you is that we have a significant part of our revenue from all these platforms. Unlike some of the other music industry players - listed and unlisted - , Saregama -- had gone out there and struck relationships with all the 9 platforms and got that efficiency level 2.5 to 3 years ago.\n\nSome of the other guys have been able to do it only over the last 12 months. So, we already had a step jump that we had seen in our revenues in the past. So, there was no new platform coming in. We've already been running on full efficiency there. The impact was a little bigger on us as these 3 platforms- Resso, Gaana, and Hungama \u2013 were significant. We have been able to counter the impact you are seeing on the revenue by increasing revenue from the other verticals.\n\nThe good news is that come quarter 4, the entire thing will be factored in. After that, we will be back on track to start achieving 25%, 26% revenue growth at the company level.\n\nPulkit Chawla: That's helpful. Second, on Resso, I think now that Resso has started to move to India, do we see any financial impact here or these users that transitioned to a different platform? And consequently, like a company like ours -- it's not a...\n\nVikram Mehra: Resso had completely moved from free to paid. Revenue had come down dramatically, and that has been factored in. This is the third quarter in which that has been factored in.\n\nPage 8 of 21\n\nSaregama India Limited February 09, 2024\n\nPulkit\n\nChawla:\n\nAnd do\n\nalso foresee\n\nsome\n\n--\n\nthat\n\nsome\n\nmore players might shut shop and maybe",

Keval: So first of all, sir, can you throw some light on how are the payment terms different under free subscription and paid wall? Vikram Mehra: Typically, on the free side, we get paid on an average INRO.10 per stream. If then somebody listens to our song -- say free customer, on an average, we get paid INR0.10. And if it's a paid customer, we get a share, which is roughly 50% of what the customer is paying. We get a share of that 50% based on actual consumption. So, if you have heard 50 songs, suppose you are INR100 subscriber, then around INR50 will be treated as the content pool which will get equally divided across all the songs you heard during the month. So, if you heard 50 songs, then every song starts becoming worth INR 1 ; if you heard 100 songs, every song starts becoming worth INR0.50. That's the pay part. Free part is INR0.10 flat on per stream heard. In the case, the platform is offering both free and pay, we charge a minimum guarantee typically. If the platform is only pay, we take away this condition of minimum guarantee. Keval: Understood sir. So again, a question on that. So, let's say, it's up on a paid customer, he listens to 100 songs, and he has paid INR500 for subscription. So now I understand that, that INR500, 50% of that divides between 100 songs and it's paid to the particular labels. Now in the case, let's say, he hears 1,000 songs for that INR500 of subscription. So, isn't it a double-edged sword that on paid wall, we might even get lower remuneration compared to free side?",

If then somebody listens to our song -- say free customer, on an average, we get paid INR0.10. And if it's a paid customer, we get a share, which is roughly 50% of what the customer is paying. We get a share of that 50% based on actual consumption.</td></tr><tr><td>So, if you have heard 50 songs, suppose you are INR100 subscriber, then around INR50 will be treated as the content pool which will get equally divided across all the songs you heard during the month. So, if you heard 50 songs, then every song starts becoming worth INR 1 ; if you heard 100 songs, every song starts becoming worth INR0.50.</td></tr><tr><td>That's the pay part. Free part is INR0.10 flat on per stream heard. In the case, the platform is offering both free and pay, we charge a minimum guarantee typically. If the platform is only pay, we take away this condition of minimum guarantee.</td></tr><tr><td>Keval:</td><td>Understood sir. So again, a question on that. So, let's say, it's up on a paid customer, he listens to 100 songs, and he has paid INR500 for subscription. So now I understand that, that INR500, 50% of that divides between 100 songs and it's paid to the particular labels. Now in the case, let's say, he hears 1,000 songs for that INR500 of subscription. So, isn't it a double-edged sword that on paid wall, we might even get lower remuneration compared to free side?</td></tr></table>",

In that case, the deal structures are going to get changed once again.

Most people like you and me typically don't get that kind of a time to listen to music on a daily basis, month after month at that significant number. Deals are all done keeping in mind the amount of consumption, which is happening. We are getting data on the consumption basis also. So, we know what we are getting with the guys who have turned paid. We believe at this juncture, looking at that data, the value of a song heard by our paid customer is any time between 2.5 to 5x of song heard by a free customer. Keval: Understood, sir. And sir, last question that you mentioned. Payments from three platforms have been stopped. So, what is the reason? And how big is the impact of that? Vikram Mehra: Correction- minimum guarantees are stopped because they have moved from free to pay. And in pay, we don't charge minimum guarantees, as their pay business is yet to build up.
